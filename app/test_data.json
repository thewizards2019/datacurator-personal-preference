[{"content": "assume nothing . \nthe phrase is perhaps one of the most used of the 1990's , as first impressions and rumors are hardly ever what they seem to be . \nthe phrase especially goes for oscar novak , an architect who is the main focus of three to tango , a delightful , funny romantic comedy about assumptions and being yourself . \nnovak ( matthew perry ) , a shy , clumsy , chicago based architect , along with openly gay partner , peter steinberg ( oliver platt ) , fights for projects day in and day out . \none of these is the job of restoring a popular building for charles newman ( dylan mcdermott ) , a rich , well-known businessman . \ncharles immediately takes a liking to oscar , as he enjoys his personality and sense of humor . \nseeing oscar as someone he could trust , charles asks him to watch his girlfriend , an unpredictable , adventurous girl named amy post ( neve campbell ) , who makes a living by blowing glass . \ncharles wants to know who she talks to , what she does , and where she goes . \nthe point ? \nto make sure she's not seeing someone else , of course . \noscar gladly takes the job , and meets amy at an art show of hers , and sparks fly between the two from the get go . \noscar feels he has found the one meant for him , and he is content with the idea of being with amy . \nwell , another popular phrase of the 90's is \" all good things must come to an end , \" and this stays true for oscar as well . \ncharles walks in on amy and oscar having a drink one night , as oscar and amy have become great friends , but he doesn't seem to mind . \nwhy is this ? \nhe thinks oscar is gay . \nhe's not afraid to share this with him either . \noscar stands in shock after the words , \" i swear if you weren't gay oscar , i'd have to kill you , \" are muttered flamboyantly from charles' mouth . \nthe word spreads instantly through town . \nwill oscar \" come out \" of his supposed gayness , or will he tell everyone that he isn't ? \none would immediately think he would deny the fact , but numerous occurrences come to oscar , which result in the fact that if he denies the fact , he could lose his job with charles . \nmatthew perry doesn't escape his character as chandler on the already classic t . v . \ncomedy \" friends , \" as both oscar novak and chandler are clueless , shy , and sensitive . \nnonetheless , perry is hilarious here , and shows that he can handle drama , as obviously , his character suffers quite a bit here . \nit's wonderful to see neve campbell outside of a horror movie , ( she was the star of scream 1 and 2 , and the upcoming scream 3 ) as she handles comedy superbly here . \nher voice , smile , and personality are more than perfect for romantic comedies- stay with this genre , neve . \nneve is delightful as her conflicted character , who feels love for oscar , but knows , based on rumors , that he is gay . \nas usual , campbell is likable as her likable character . \nunlike the other two leads here , dylan mcdermott is flat in his dialogue , and is never convincing . \nwhen his character his present , mcdermott sets a dull tone to the scene with his horrible acting . \nstick to the t . v . \ndrama , the practice , dylan . \nthe major weak spot in three to tango is the direction of damon santostefano . \nno originality or technique is used whatsoever . \nthree to tango is lucky that the script is so edgy and that perry and campbell are wonderful in comedy , or else the film would have been a disaster , as it is just plain boring to look at . \nthree to tango is a film done many times before , as the plot is suspiciously close to 1998's the object of my affection , but the plot has never been completed so well . \nthree to tango's script , written by rodney patrick vaccaro and aline brosh mckenna is fun , fast , and funny , delivering not only original , hilarious gay jokes ( not your run of the mill material ) , but a certain snappiness in the dialogue between characters that always keeps you smiling . \nunlike last summer's south park : bigger , longer , and uncut and 1997's in & out , three to tango is a comedy in which the gay element is not crude or vulgar . \nthe script is wise to take this route , as gays can't ( i don't think so , anyway ) be offended by this light , playful comedy . \n ( to prove this , a gay couple was in the audience who were laughing constantly . ) \nthree to tango's climax is a hilarious , clever scene that is pure irony based on the outcome of most romantic-mistaken identity comedies . \nthree to tango is a gem . \nthe bottom line : three to tango is a light , sharp , snappy romantic comedy with a superb ending , and great stars . \none of the better romantic comedies of 1999 . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "plot : derek zoolander is a male model . \nhe is also very dumb and impressionable . \nfor that reason , he is secretly hired and trained ( so secret , that even he doesn't know about it ) by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , who wants to abolish child labor in his country . \nwill zoolander fulfill the dirty deed ? \nwill zoolander ever grace the world his new \" look \" ? \nis this a funny movie ? \nfind out below . . . \ncritique : there's a place in our world for \" stupid comedies \" . \nfilms which don't pretend to take themselves seriously , are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb jokes . \nthere's also a time for them and many would argue that this difficult period of our history , might be an ideal circumstance during which to \" relax \" by watching something so completely frivolous . \nwell , if you're in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment , ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time . \nof course , comedies as such are usually very subjective and i could see how some will see this film simply as stupid and unfunny , while others will grant them the \" stupid \" , but consider it funny instead . \ni personally enjoyed it for the most part , cracked up loudly during a couple of specific sequences and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry . \nsnap ! \nit was also nice to see several real-life models with small roles in the movie , not taking themselves too seriously . \nand if you're the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films , well , don't look any further because dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn , billy zane , winona ryder , christian slater , david duchovny , natalie portman and many , many others . \ni especially liked andy dick's complete make-over as the masseuse . \nhi-larious ! \nbut with all films of this type , there is bound to be some stuff that simply doesn't work . \na few particulars which didn't strike my fancy included the bulimia and \" orgy \" sequence with christine taylor , the break-dance fighting , and i also never get why they use real countries in plots like this ( why not just \" make up \" a country , instead of zeroing in on a certain people ? ) . \ni also could have done with less of the taylor character in general , since she wasn't all that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then ( more zoolander , dude ! ) . \nbut those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes which definitely did work for me ! \ni almost pissed myself during the \" gas station \" disaster , absolutely adored the \" walk-off \" contest ( with david bowie as the judge , no less ) and appreciated many of zoolander's moronic one-liners ( \" i was a merman . . . a \nmerman ! ! \" ) . \nand i dare you to get his \" monkey \" photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie ( \" you're a monkey , derek . . . a \nmonkey ! \" ) \ni also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film , both of which zipped and zagged , and established a nice rhythm to it all . \nagain , it's to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone , but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer , you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well . \nif you thought the trailer was dumb , skip this dodo bird and go rent austin powers again or something , a film from which there is an obvious influence here . \nblue

live-action-disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins , separated at birth by divorcing parents , never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again . \nand everyone should know how i feel about remakes , especially of films i happen to enjoy ( my fallacy : unless you're going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both , just wrack your brain and come up with a * gasp * new idea ) . \nthis remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list , and was actually quite the opposite . \ncontemporary live-action-disney films are not one of my favorties , anyway : they're usually unfunny , alienating , and a big fat bore , at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10 . \nthis one , however , is shockingly not bad . \nin fact , it's actually good . \nnot the original good , but what's great about it is that it doesn't necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining . \nbecause it's cute and innocent fun . \nbecause it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with . \nbecause the lead star is immensely appealing . \nbecause the parents are also immensely appealing . \nand ( i'm repeating myself ) because it's cute and innocent fun . \nthere's nothing too risque about it , save the plot ( the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish , but that is precisely the point of the movie ) , and it's aimed directly at either kids , adults who want to remember the original , or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid . \ni , personally , am somewhere between the second and third . \ni can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn't so weird or diverse ( the names godard and kubrick weren't even a glimmer in my right eye back then ) , when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc's \" wonderful world of disney , \" where they'd show you a live-action and/or made-for-tv disney flick an hour per week . \ni can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films ( like \" lady and the tramp \" and \" pinnochio \" ) . \nand , most sadly , i remember every single christmas , without fail , there were a barage of children's animated half-hour shows , made exclusively for the christmas season , that i wouldn't dare missing . \ni can even remember seeing the made-for-tv \" parent trap ii \" on tv one night , and after i had seen that one over and over and over again , i saw the original \" parent trap . \" \nit's more of a late childhood movie , because it deals with the issue of divorce , but it deals with it in a disney-ized version . \nit's playful , and witty , and charming , and if i saw it for the first time right now , having never experienced that part of my childhood , i'd probably dismiss it . \ni'd probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn't seen the original at such a perfect age . \nwatching it , i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film , and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly-perfect parents splitting up , and how it affected my adolescence . \nand also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke , and pointed out that even in the most fucked-up of situations , things could always work out if you , well , manipulate things a bit , at least for the better . \nthis new version did that for me , but it's also charming in its own way . \nit has a new cast , a contemporary feel , and , for the first time in awhile for a live-action-disney flick , a tone that isn't corny or condescending , but just right . \nthe moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way . \nand for the first time since the original film , the kids actually know better than the foolish adults . \nthe story is basically classic by now , repeated almost as many times as kurosawa's \" the seven samurai \" : a pair of twins ( played here by lindsay lohan , just like they were played by hayley mills in the original ) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents . \none , annie , is sent to live with the mother ( natasha richardson , resembling her mother , vanessa redgrave , more than i had ever noticed ) in london , where she lives with her parents and her devoted , foppish butler ( simon kunz ) , as she works as a swingin' fashion designer . \nshe grows up refined and classy , but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker-playing . \nthe other , hallie , is sent to northern california with her father ( dennis quaid ) to live on a vineyard with their pseudo-maid ( lisa ann walter ) , and grows up rugged yet charming . \nthey both meet at the same camp , one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged . \nthey feud because they look all-too similar , and are thus in tight competition , which results in some nasty pranks , which winds them in seclusion together in a private , out-of-the-way cabin . \nthere , they become friends , then learn about eachother . \nonce they know everything , they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent , whom they've only heard of . \nthey learn about eachother's lives in detail , they make sure they look alike ( which requires hair cutting and , notoriously , ear-piercing - a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in \" pulp fiction \" ) , and when the end of summer comes , they switch and hope for the best . \nlindsay lohan doesn't necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original . \nbut she comes off just as appealing as she did once . \nshe does , though , add a couple new things : she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original , respectively . \nshe also adds on an american and british accent to each one , with one faking the other accent throughout , and if you really take notice , you can see that the fake ones' accents aren't exactly perfect . \nshe's also incredibly appealing , not merely cute , which is especially notable since this is her first feature film , and we know how notorious child actors are , especially in their first films . \nshe makes a great protagonist , and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing . \ndennis quaid , in fact , hasn't been this likable in about a decade - his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past , not just that he's mr . meg ryan . \nditto natasha richardson ( except that she just hasn't ever been this likable period ) . \nthe two make a winning couple , maybe not so winning as maureen o'hara and the late brian keith in the original , but they still work for this film . \ninstead of the bickering that ensued in the original , the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original : during the opening credits , we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe2 , where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother , and when back together again , the film's more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental , but in that great way , not the migraine-inducing way as in many such films . \nthis all brings this new \" parent trap \" to a level of entertainment that hasn't really existed since , well , the original film years ago , still my money the best live-action-disney flick of all time . \nthis is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot ( a gold-digging sharon stone type , played by elaine hendrix , who's deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film ) a treat instead of a bore . \nlike the original , this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be ( case in point : \" it takes two \" starring the olsen twins ) because it treats the children as the smart ones , and the adults as the silly ones , not the other way around . \nand because , above everything , it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew . \nhowever , in comparison with the original , it could be a bit better . \ncertain scenes work well , but not nearly as well as they worked in the original . \ni liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine - somehow , feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing , a lesson extracted from the howard hawks/cary grant films of yesteryear . \nand as much as this film transcends mere cutedom , compared to the original , this film almost drowns in cutedom . \nthe original , though not gritty , was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences . \nas such , this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film , but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect , and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "a movie that's been as highly built up as the truman show , with reviews boasting , \" the

fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film , as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films . \nwell , 1999 has two of them , the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family , american beauty . \nthe story of us , a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family , is a well written , heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience , including myself , cry . \nthe story of us tells the story of ben ( bruce willis ) and katie ( michelle pfeiffer ) jordan , and asks the question , \" can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage ? \" \nthe film is about two individuals who have come together , spent a good chunk of their lives together , and shows when our main characters are \" him \" and \" her \" ( during the bad times ) , and when they are \" us \" ( during the good times ) . \nthe story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day . \nben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don't want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer , or at least say they don't , love each other anymore . \nben , a cartoonist , and katie , a crossword puzzle writer , have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage , as they have grown to follow different views on life , family , and marriage . \nkatie is the more organized , sophisticated type , who wants to plan everything out , while ben is a spontaneous , adventurous individual who doesn't mind doing things differently than they were planned . \nthe story of us plays out nicely , as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist , told to the viewer through flashbacks . \nas the film progresses , it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist , with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage . \nthis method is highly effective , as we see the characters changing from year to year , slowly growing apart . \nthrough the flashbacks , we get to see the story of them through both of the character's eyes , and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like , as the story of us has three dimensional , believable main characters . \nthe screenplay , written by jessie nelson ( stepmom ) and alan zweibel ( dragnet ) , is a touching , down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer , much like another one of nelson's films , stepmom . \nthe script has an open honesty and outlook on life , one that is so realistic , you feel uncomfortable at many times , because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar , as most families these days most go through the hard times , as ben and katie must . \nif it wasn't for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote , which are rugged and certainly flawed , the story of us would have been this year's best picture . \nbruce willis , a usual action/adventure star , has certainly turned himself around in the past year- he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies , to a distinguished , sophisticated actor , as in last summer's the sixth sense ; and now in the story of us , willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script . \nalthough i wouldn't pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan , willis handles himself nicely , and shines in a few of the film's most powerful scenes , enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season . \nwhere to start about michelle pfeiffer ? \npfeiffer's performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong , as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion , you wonder how , how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism . \npfeiffer's performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring , will be in the heart's of any viewer that has watched this moving film . \nthe story of us is one of 1999's most real , yet funny films , as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked . \nsuperb acting , direction , writing , story , and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film , which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman , make the story of us a touching , unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country- and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall . \nthe film's major high points are the fights between ben and katie , as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed , and although they also say things like \" it's over , \" or \" i hate you , \" you can tell the two still share a deep connection , and that inside , somewhere , they are still an \" us . \" \nthe bottom line : a wonderful , enchanting , and heartbreaking film . \none of the most realistic , heartbreaking films in recent years .

\nstuart little is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video . \nthere are two different dvds on sale : one contains the film in full frame , and the other presents the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 66 : 1 . \nboth versions feature choices of either dolby surround or dolby digital 5 . 1 audio . \nboth versions also contain the following extras ( and hang in there with me here . . . there's a lot of them ) : a full length audio commentary track by director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson , a full length audio commentary track by the visual effects supervisors , an isolated score track , an interactive trivia game , an interactive featurette that goes step by step through eight of the effects in the film , a making of documentary that originally aried on hbo , and a stuart little read-along story ( which you can read yourself or have stuart read for you ) . \nthere are also three music videos , and six theatrical trailers ( called thecatrical trailers . . . \nget it ? \nit's funny ! ) for stuart little and five other columbia tristar releases : the adventures of elmo in grouchland , madeline , the nuttiest nutcracker , muppets from space , and baby geniuses ( the only bad thing about this entire dvd . . . \ni did not want to be reminded of the awfulness that is baby geniuses ) . \ndvd-rom features are also on the disc , including web links and a demo of the stuart little cd-rom game . \nbut wait . . . \nthere's still more ! \nthere's a section called \" basement treasures \" where you will find the auditions of the film's animators , six deleted scenes which you can select to view with or without commentary from the director , a visual effects gag reel , a production gag reel , and an incredible eight minute storyboard sequence detailing the original concept for the boat race scene ( with commentary from the director ) . \nthe first commentary track features director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson . \nthey give insightful and detailed thoughts about the film's production . \nminkoff likes to point out scenes where other screenwriters came in and polished up the script , namely writers like scott alexander and larry karaszewski ( who wrote the people vs . larry flynt and ed wood ) and lowell ganz and babaloo mandel ( who wrote splash and multiplicity , among others ) . \nanderson is very appreciative of the animators who worked with him and often points out which animator worked on each scene as they occur . \nthe second commentary track features visual effects supervisors john dykstra and jerome chen who discuss more specific details of the effects in the film . \nmovie fans will enjoy the informative first commentary track , serious animation buffs will love the second one . \nnow i know this is slightly off topic , but it is related specifically to this dvd so i must voice this now . \none of the music videos on the disc is for a song called \" i need to know \" by a group called r angels . \nthis video features four mid-teenage girls ( the singers obviously ) having a slumber party . \nthe girls ask a ouija board \" i need to know . . . \nwho to do , who to do , who to do \" as the song begins . \nthey then sneak out of their house , and along the way they strike a pose and their slumber party pajamas are magically transformed into middle class streetwalker outfits . \nthen they head to a party and dance suggestively with the guys while singing lyrics like \" i'll be your pleasure all the time . . . \njust say the words that you'll be mine \" . \num . . . \nwhat the hell ? \nwhat does this have to do with stuart little ? \nhow is this in any way a song suitable for a kids movie , let alone a video suitable for a kids movie on dvd ? \nwhen the video concludes , the words \" to be continued \" appear . \noh i can't wait to see who they've slept with when the toy story 2 dvd comes out . \nkids won't care about most of the special features on this dvd , but those of us who can sometimes be turned into a \" kid at heart \" thanks to a winning family film sure appreciate them . \nthis is the way to do dvd , a good movie loaded with great features at a reasonable cost . \nthe di$ney people could learn a lot from columbia tristar . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "before you read my review , you gotta know that i love woody allen . \nthis is a very important note because allen's films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone . \ni know folks who believe him to be a complete genius , while others see him as a dirty ol' schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again . \ni love most of his films , but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the 90s . \nin fact , why he felt the need to make 10 movies in those 10 years is beyond me ! \nif you look at the quality of those films , you'll hear what i'm saying . \nthe only two films of his that i really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives . \nin fact , i secretly hoped that he would take some \" time off \" at the turn of the millennium , just to re-energize or something , but it doesn't appear as though he has any intention of doing that . \nso here i am again , reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old . \nplot : the year is 1940 and woody allen is a top-notch insurance investigator . \nhis methods are very old-fashioned and apparently out of date . \na new employee ( hunt ) has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency . \nthe two do not like each other . \none night , they are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magician , and unbeknownst to them , placed under his control . \nsoon thereafter , jewels are stolen , words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer . \ncritique : a wonderful recreation of the 1940s style movies , with the fast-talking witty banter between co-workers , a catchy jazz score moving things along , film noirish elements such as the veronica lake-type sexpot , one-liners galore and a fluffy , if inconsequential plotline . \non the downside , the film actually starts off pretty slowly , with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there , but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy . \nthe sets , on the other hand , were amazing , the production design and costumes were perfect , and the casting ideal , so i kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man . \nbut it wasn't not long before i was fully engaged by the characters , entertained by the many zingers delivered back-and-forth between allen and hunt , and actually interested in the resolution of the flick . \ni also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old , parody and actual reinvention ( note theron's entire female persona that is drenched in film noir- very cool ) . \nof course , films like this ( with little or no real tension in the plot ) need solid actors to keep you interested in the quick-fire dialogue , and once again , allen does a great job in playing his character , who for once , isn't his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude . \nhe actually plays a \" macho \" guy here and handles it pretty well , especially the scenes in which he's hypnotized . \nbut the bigger surprise for me in this film was helen hunt , an actress who i was openly \" sick of seeing \" in movies late last year ( sorry babe , you were just in too many at the same time ! ) . \nanyway , she's really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men , and doesn't miss a beat of allen's fast-paced dialogue . \ni didn't care much for her running joke about him \" dying \" whenever he left a room , but overall she was really good and i especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did . . . yum , \nyum ! \nharumph , but i digress . \nso let's recap . \na great looking picture with a nice jazzy score , some funny one-liners , especially in the second half , a decent plotline , although you shouldn't expect a real mystery or anything , and some solid acting all around . \ni can't say that this is even remotely close to any of allen's best work , but i certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction , especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through . \nit's probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else , but i would still recommend this film to anyone looking for a cute , \" old-school \" kind of vibe , with chemistry between the leads , zippy dialogue and a satisfying conclusion . \nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : annie hall ( 10/10 ) - celebrity ( 5/10 ) - everyone says i love you ( 5/10 ) - husbands and wives ( 9/10 )

\nwhen i first saw the advertisement for the truman show , i thought , \" what a hilarious idea for a movie ! \" \nhowever , it was an even better premise for a drama . \nthe truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man . \nthat man is truman burbank ( jim carrey ) . \ntruman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly , cristof wants to keep it that way . \nchristof is the \" god \" of this made-up world . \nhe keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles . \nthere were a few attempts to tell truman about his world , but they failed and life went on as normal . \nthe opening parts of the film introduce to truman's world . \nwe see what he is doing at his current age , then we get a flashback at his past . \nit may seem a tad boring , but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start . \nthe film can be described in one word : weird . \nit seems like such a simple idea , yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of , but andrew niccol did . \nit seems like a warped idea , but it is andrew's idea and he did wonders with it . \njim carrey actually lived up to the hype . \nthe hype , whether good or bad , always focused on carrey's ability to do drama . \nno one doubted how extraordinary this film could be , the only thing they doubted was carrey . \nand he showed them all up . \njim carrey was snubbed at the oscars . \ni do not think he was the best actor , but he deserved the nomination . \nhe plays truman burbank , the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world . \nhe has lived a normal life for almost thirty years , but then strange things start happening . \nhe ventures into the wrong elevator . \na light crashes in front of him . \nhis father comes back and is then pulled away . \nwe are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show , but truman does not . \nand it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish . \ncarrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama . \nlaura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife . \nshe plays her role as advertiser and budding star to a point . \npeter weir does not make the cast perfect , and their flaws eventually lead to truman's escape . \nthe story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down . \ndespite carrey's greatness , the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris , who plays the \" god \" of truman's world . \nhe displays the pressure he is under , the world he has created . \nhe becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life . \nthe action moves at a good pace , and rarely gets sluggish . \nbut , the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show . \nit really makes you think . \nmaybe your brother is an actor , maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show . \nsome of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking . \nor when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for truman's arrival . \nand when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon ( noah emmerich ) delivers his dramatic line . \nall of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative . \ni was not only enjoying the film , i was overwhelmed by genius of it . \noverall , the truman show is one of the freshest and innovative films to come out of hollywood . \njim carrey shows that he is not just a man of a million faces , but a legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best . \nandrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off to perfection . \nthe truman show is a must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "i rented \" brokedown palace \" last night blind , having heard nothing about it beforehand , and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws . \nfor anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety . \nthat is no easy task . \nsuperficially , it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies , notably \" return to paradise \" and \" midnight express . \" \nas a result nearly every review of \" brokedown palace \" i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons . \nthe consequence was nearly universal condemnation , which is a shame as this is a fine film . \nfor those who have yet to view the movie , let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was \" midnight express \" ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of \" return to paradise . \" \nin my view , if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad's acclaimed novel , \" lord jim . \" \nproblematically , the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set-up involving a suave con-man , a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world \" justice \" system . \nthe girls are alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale ) . \nthey're life-long buddies who planned a high-school graduation trip to hawaii , and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents . \nonce there , they find a $6 hotel and go sight-seeing , which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside . \nthey get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room , a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them , but they are saved from hotel security by a charming , friendly australian , nick ( daniel lapaine ) , who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl's scam . \nhe then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves , first toward alice , then toward darlene . \nby now alarm bells are going off among viewers . \nthe ever-present nick is too slick and his stories don't add up ( to us ) --the girls , of course , are too naive to notice . \nlong before it happens , we're anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast-talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting-ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag ( literally ) containing heroin . \njust as predictably , the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison-bound for a long stretch . \nleft unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice . \nfor those in need of a ready answer , might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl's fleabag hotel . \nas one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed , the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer/fixer \" yankee hank \" ( bill pullam ) and his thai-born partner-wife . \na recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film's tag lines , \" who do you trust ? , \" and hank is no exception although seasoned movie- goers and those familiar with pullman's oeuvre will find few surprises . \nmuch of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short-hand fashion . \nlou diamond phillips , for instance , plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who , while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank , withholds vital information at crucial moments . \nis he part of a wider conspiracy ? \nwith an inherently powerful , if somewhat tired premise , the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama , a prison story , and a potential character study of american teens , their relationship , and what constitutes friendship between them . \nthe result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful , with the girls' interaction , hank's investigation , and the various trials and hearings , offering hope for their release , delivering tension--as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape . \nif \" brokedown palace \" has a major flaw , it is its creators' tendency , like time-constrained tourists , to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half-way down and return to the story's main avenue . \nand , if that were all there was to \" brokedown palace , \" it wouldn't be a very good movie . \nbut i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and , in this , they succeeded . \nfor the main theme of the movie , like the proffered name of its location , is freedom--in all its permutations . \nultimately , the other sub-themes may be considered window dressing . \nyoung and pretty , alice ( danes ) is an old soul ; a wild , streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure . \npresented as a perfect blend of yin and yang , dark and light , is her cautious best friend , darlene ( beckinsale ) . \nclear-eyed and straightforward , alice is more complex than her friend . \nshe comes from a poorer background , has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone ( including her own father ) . \nwhereas darlene's life is \" on-track , \" aimed at college , marriage , kids , a career , a suburban home , middle age and \" fulfillment , \" alice's is uncertain , unfocused , and yearning . \none poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors--friends and relatives from home , whose lives continue while hers is in limbo . \ntellingly , alice is present but not included . \njust as revealing of their different personalities , when alice and dar first come to thailand , the openness and delight on alice's face doesn't read as simple naivet ? ; the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat , reaching toward the sun , she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom , while \" dar \" remains seated in the shade . \n \" brokedown palace \" begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank . \nhowever unintentional , it's all alice's fault . \nshe's responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents , to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand , to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick . \n ( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film's beginning , darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison . ) \ndar , of course , is the willing dupe which , in her view , confers innocence . \nnever mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate . \ndar is innocent . \nit doesn't matter . \nalice is the subject of this movie . \nshe and her journey toward personal freedom . \nalong the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half-baked sensibilities and materialistic goals . \nin the end , that culture , like its representatives , \" yankee \" hank and dar's father ( a \" man who knows how to grease the wheels \" ) , proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl's tragedy . \nthailand's culture , contrary to most opinion , comes off much better by comparison . \nit amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes . \ni believe the filmmaker's view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior . \nthe thai ( with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy ) were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles . \nthe girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native-born . \ntheir prison ( in stark contrast to the probable reality ) was no hellhole , being relatively clean and sunlit . \nthe prison authorities demanded good hygiene , provided medical care when needed , and \" hard manual labor \" consisted of picking grass ! \nthe thai guards were authoritarian ( what else ? ) but certainly not routinely sadistic . \nas for the thai justice system , the reasoning of the thai judges , during both an appeal hearing and in the film's penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality . \n'freedom' has many faces and \" brokedown palace \" explores many of them . \nin the extreme , we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit . \nsome settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter . \nbut freedom seldom comes without a price . \nwhich is why the movie's other tag lines are : \" what is your dream ? \" \nand \" how far would you go ? \" \ni believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom , incarcerated or not , by film's end is alice . \nshe finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility . \ni think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact . \nkate beckinsale's character might more properly be likened to the \" released \" temple bird referred to twice during the film , \" trained to fly back to its cage . \" \nas the thai magistrate observed in the film's climactic scene , the issue was always one of \" character ; \" and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that \" freedom \" is achieved within oneself . \nif one thinks back over the movie , which character was transformed by their experiences ? \nincreasingly , the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of 'kung fu woman'--female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures . \nhere , at last , is the story of a modern heroine . \nin reading the many user's comments , i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon : whether or not a person liked the movie , almost everyone praised the actors . \nthink about that . \nwhen was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it , but raving about all the performances in it ? \ndo yourself a favor : rent \" brokedown palace \" and watch it with a open mind . \nthere's more there than meets the eye . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "the thought-provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of \" leila , \" a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui , that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty-year career to gain u . s . distribution , thanks to first run features . \nalthough unfamiliar with mehrjui's previous directing efforts , perhaps the reason for this is that , while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country , the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers . \nset in modern-day iran , \" leila \" begins on the birthday of the title character ( leila hatami ) , after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband , reza ( ali mosaffa ) . \nas leila and reza set off to visit his parents , and then hers , where a birthday celebration has been planned , things seem rosy for the couple on the outside , but for leila , life isn't quite as sweet . \nearlier , on that very same day , leila had gone to see her physician , and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child . \nwhen all of the conditions are ruled out , and leila passes up the possibility of adoption , reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her , and doesn't care at all about having children . \nnonetheless , leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby , which is the societal norm , and her self-esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother-in-law ( jamileh sheikhi ) , whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news ( reza is her only son ) . \nbluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and , in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition , she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with . \nleila hesitantly agrees , and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens' inadequacies , reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like , even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn't give her full blessing . \nthere are no easy answers to be found within \" leila , \" a film that thoughtfully examines the central character's unfortunate plight , as well as the inner workings of leila herself , told through matter-of-fact narration . \nalmost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother-in-law's requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman . \nmaybe because \" leila \" is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence . \nleila , however , is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily , but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy , no matter what the circumstances . \none of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza , who married only three months after their first meeting , but obviously love each other very deeply . \nit is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible . \nalthough seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another . \nditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her . \nthese \" small \" moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman . \nleft there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage , foolishly unbeknownst to reza , leila prays each time that the date will not go well , so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer . \nrefusing to stay over at her parent's house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below . \ndespite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him . \nsure , the whole second marriage was his mother's idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn't he ? \nin the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair . \nunlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words . \nevery bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else . \nfor all of its strong aspects , \" leila \" isn't a perfect film . \non a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed . \nand concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before . \nmehrjui's decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice , particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother-in-law , played memorably by jamileh sheikhi . \ndespite these minor missteps , \" leila \" is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york's cinema village , and then on may 21 in la . \nthe thought-provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales , and when the climax arrives , leila's self-worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation , to which there is no return . \nit's difficult to not consider how leila's culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided , had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila , the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme , was going through . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "first , i am not a big fan of the x-files tv series . \ni have nothing against it particularly , i just don't happen to watch it . \nhaving said that , i can now say that i liked the x-files pretty well . \nfor us non-fans , there's nothing big going for it , but there are a lot of little things . \nthe movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35 , 000 b . c . \ntwo proto-humans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside . \nthe alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien . \nthe movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy ( lucas black , from sling blade ) is captured by the same black ooze . \nwe then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder ( gillian anderson and david duchovny ) , who have been pulled off of their previous assignment ( investigations into the paranormal ) and put onto the bomb squad detail . \na caller has threatened a federal building in dallas , texas . \non a hunch , mulder checks out the

what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me . \nit didn't . \nthe possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them . \nbut the point of the x-files is not what the truth is , but the extent to which it has been hidden . \nit's a slightly more interesting angle , but it still raises expectations about that \" truth \" too high . \nif this were the whole film , i would say the movie was mediocre , perhaps even boring . \nbut there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it . \nthe pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest . \nbefore the audience can get tired of one location , the agents follow a hot tip to another location , and so on and so forth . \nthe locations are not all computer-generated sets , either . \nthere are some artificial settings , but the desert night of nevada , the edge of suburbia in texas , and the endless fields of snow in antarctica ( actually somewhere in north america . ) \nmake this fantastic film feel more real . \nward russell's cinematography is very good . \nthe overall look is dark and ominous , appropriate to the intended tone of the film's plot . \nrussell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding . \nwhen the movie is set in darkness , the picture quality is still rich and detailed . \nfinally , and specifically , there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train . \ni don't know if the shot is faked in any way , but it looks dangerous , and it looks great . \nthe movie's soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film .

anyone familiar with the series of star trek movies knows of the \" even-odd pattern \" --the even-numbered installments of the series are good while the odd-numbered ones are , well , not-so-good . \nthe pattern continues with the new star trek : first contact , an energetic sci-fi adventure that ( coincidentally ? ) is the eighth entry in the hugely popular series . \nin this first trek feature to feature only cast members from the late star trek : the next generation television series , captain jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the rest of the 24th-century crew of the starship enterprise--commander will riker ( jonathan frakes , who also directed ) , android lt . cmdr . \ndata ( brent spiner ) , lt . cmdr . \ngeordi laforge ( levar burton ) , lt . cmdr . \nworf ( michael dorn ) , dr . beverly crusher ( gates mcfadden ) , and counselor deanna troi ( marina sirtis ) --travel back to 21st-century earth while doing battle with the borg , a race of cybernetic beings that share a collective mind with the borg queen ( alice krige ) . \nthe borg intend to alter history and assimilate all of humankind into their race--starting with the earth-orbiting crew of the enterprise and a 21st century stowaway ( alfre woodard ) . \nthis is an interesting plotline that is sure to mesmerize trekkers everywhere and engage everyone else , but , unfortunately , it only makes up the star trek half of the script by brannon braga and ronald d . moore . \nthe other half of the title--first contact--refers to a subplot that takes place on 21st-century earth , where riker , troi , and laforge meet legendary scientist zephram cochran ( james cromwell ) , who is about to embark on the first warp speed flight in human history , which directly leads to the first contact with extraterrestrials . \nwhile this story does tie into the main plot and pays off interestingly in the end , it is nowhere near as involving or exciting as the borg battles on the enterprise . \nnot helping matters is the tiresome cochran character , an eccentric whose drunken schtick starts out funny but becomes too one-note after a while . \nin the end , though , the first contact subplot doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the film as a whole . \nthe story is typical sci-fi fantasy , but the conviction of the cast--most notably the always-phenomenal stewart--makes you believe and care . \nfrakes , making his feature directorial debut , keeps the action swiftly rolling along and delivers the action goods , even upping the violence a notch ( this is the first trek film to bear a pg-13 rating ) to greater effect . \nst : fc has a bigger budget than the last trek outing , the middling star trek generations , and it definitely shows on screen--the production design and especially visual and makeup effects are outstanding ( in particular those involving the borg queen ) . \nbraga and moore's mostly sharp script will please both trek devotees and the rest ; the references to the borg storyline in the tv series , the continuity with the previous film ( e . g . \nthe ongoing saga of data's emotion chip ) , and a fleeting star trek : voyager crossover will make trekkers squeal with delight , but such points are made easily accessible to those less familiar to the trek mythos . \nparamount was reportedly worried about the staying power of its trek franchise with the next generation cast now carrying the helm . \nbased on the entertaining success that is star trek : first contact , i'd say the studio has nothing to worry about ( at least not until this cast retires and the crew of the wan star trek : deep space nine takes over . . . ) . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "meet joe black ( reviewed on nov . 27/98 ) \nstarring brad pitt , anthony hopkins ,

through ) . \nthe film starts off with four talented , aspiring teenage friends who have just graduated from high school in their small boating town of southport , n . c . \nit is the 4th of july ,

summer , \" is a successful horror film for a number of reasons . \nthe cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian , as it put shadows , fog , steam , and other clever devices to add atmosphere to the proceedings . \nthe characters , particularly julie and helen , are realistically written , and the film amazingly deals with their broken relationship in a few scenes , which is largely uncharacteristic in films of this sort . \nand last , the film creates a few dazzling and scary set-pieces that are some of the most memorable i've seen in a horror movie , particularly the suspenseful , superbly shot sequence involving helen at her family's store with the killer inside with her . \nperhaps the best character is that of missy egan ( anne heche ) , a lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the one julie thinks they hit . \nheche's performance is a standout , as she is able to create a full character in only about ten minutes of screen time . \n \" i know what you did last summer , \" could have been a great horror movie if not for a few problems . \nprinze jr . gives a performance to be desired here , and much of his dialogue sounds wooden coming out of his mouth . \nalso , the climax of the film almost completely loses its frightening grip after it unveils the mystery killer , who is a decidedly bad actor and should not have been given any lines . \nluckily , the penultimate scene saves the disappointing finale , which includes an expertly crafted \" jump-in-your-seat \" scare . \nin the main roles , hewitt and gellar are highly talented , and hewitt , especially , is one of the best screamers i've ever heard . \nshe honestly could give jamie lee curtis a little competition for the best \" scream queen . \" \nand gellar is

and entir e everyone , but in a different way . \n \" book of shadows \" feels incredibly controlled and restrict . \nhere , very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and \"

have the talent and originality of its predecessor . \nit resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesn't always succeed . \nbut most importantly : it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie , which doesn't allow it to destroy the original . \nin the end , i can't call it a bad effort . \nit's less artistic , not so scary and less original , but certainly not bad . \nit's simply different . \nin fact , if you haven't seen \" the blair witch project \" , you might like this film for what it is -- a cross between \" the blair witch project \" and the \" scream \" -films . \nthe only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting ( jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned ) and incredible sense of surrealism . \nbut it's a common knowledge and experience that , with a few exceptions , every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making . \nto me the story of \" the blair witch project \" seemed completed , but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that \" the book of shadows \" is certainly assured . \nand it's

perreault for free using my sony/loews critic's pass . \n[theater rating : * * 1/2 : okay seats , sound , and picture] \nmodern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes . \nthe biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it . \n \" your friends and neighbors \" takes a different approach as it's a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends . \none of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute's basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story . \nfirstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras . \neverything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full-circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative . \nbut to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult . \nlabute's ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what's specifically impressive is the fact the characters' names are never revealed until the end credits roll . \nfor the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic . \nanother interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus . \nwe're always able to tell where the characters are ( someone's home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc . ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc . is relatively unknown . \nthe film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater . \nno one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background . \nwe're simply dropped in on the characters' lives and are expected to figure out the rest . \nthe characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they're only concern right now seems to be their sex lives . \nfirst there's barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don't know what they're problem is . \nbarry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but doesn't have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else . \nmary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , doesn't hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something . \nlabute's script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two . \nobviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow . \nanother couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything . \ntheir sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship . \nif only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area . \nit's natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ? \nwhat did they ever see in the other person to begin with ? \nlabute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process , it still makes for good drama , tension , and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it's fascinating . \ntwo other characters act as catalysts , cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski ) . \ncary is an arrogant , hostile sex-maniac who defines the word \" bastard . \" \nsomehow he is able to bend women to his will , either through charm or just attitude , into getting his way . \nhe's the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he's secretly perverted , but somehow barry finds comfort in his company , although jerry is always nervous around him . \npatric gives an outstanding performance , so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is . \ncheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her . \nshe works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to brushing it off as small talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another . \nshe's a sweet woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable . \ni will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others' action , as that's the hook of the film . \nthe first two acts begin to set up the characters and each's scenarios , but it's often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom . \nthe result is sometimes surprising , other times predictable , but the actual course of actions is always fascinating . \nfor a while everyone has their fun , but ultimately each character's guilt , attitude , or ignorance will disserve them . \none of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be . \nsince the characters only interact with each other there isn't much pop culture references , as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it . \nare we to assume that these people are , as the title states , our friends and neighbors ? \ni don't know of anyone going through the same situations as these people . \noften times the film is not unlike a network melodrama , other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie . \nbut what this film does have that the others don't is repercussions in the end . \nalthough the film creates its own reality , it goes to show that even the immoral aren't immortal . \nin what way \" your friends and neighbors \" is supposed to work is open to interpretation . \nit definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity , but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically . \nstill , it's an accomplishment in film-making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "i have to admit that i disliked this film initially . \nit certianly isn't for every taste , and it's sheer torture to sit through if you're in a restless mood . \nthat said , if you are in the right mood , it's absolutely incredible . \nthis was my second favorite movie of 1998 , and would have been a shoo-in for first in almost any other year . \nperhaps the big turn-off for many was this film's unconventionality . \ni'd be hard-pressed to compare it to any other film that i've seen - it is very , very artsy , incredibly slow - and amazingly , it works beautifully . \non my second viewing , i realized that the film follows the three act structure ( i didn't think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it ) . \nthe first act serves to set up the characters - sort of . \nit exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness , and perhaps even feelings of boredom . \nand then it is shattered by the intense violence of the second ( which encompasses most of the movie ) . \nthe majority of the film is one extended battle scene , intercut with brief flashbacks and voice-overs . \nthe artsier elements do not detract from the action , but add to it - they succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers , only to be suddenly yanked back into reality when the battle resumes . \nthe battle scenes are amazing ( second only to \" saving private ryan \" in my opinion ) . \nthey're brutal , horrifying , and at times beautiful due to the amazing cinematography . \nthe second act is as immersive , brilliant , and haunting as any film that i have ever seen . \nthe only problems come during the first and third acts . \nmalick takes a little too long to get the film started . \nalthough the initial scenes - which consist of two soldiers' experiencing a near-eden-like paradise while going awol , and the preperations for battle - are effective and necessary , hints of pretentiousness sink in . \nthe film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning , and a lot of people that disliked the movie probably gave up on it because of this . \nthe final act is effective at winding the film down , but the problems from the first persist - it's a bit too long , and comes over as pretentious at times . \nthat said , there are two sequences ( one where a soldier gets a devastating note from his wife , and another where one of the main characters is killed ) that are nothing short of incredible . \nthe performances are phenominal all around . \nthe two standouts are nick nolte and newcomer jim caviezel , both of whom should have been nominated for oscars . \nnolte is riveting and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation . \nhis character is hard , mean , and somewhat reckless with the lives of his men , and yet nolte somehow manages to evoke sympathy for him . \ncaviezel is forever questioning the nature of war , his place in it , and if there's any deeper meaning to the hell that he's going through . \nhe is absolutely perfect - genuine , sympathetic , sincere , and yet strong when he needs to be . \nalthough restricted to a relatively small role , sean penn is also very good as the company's pessimistic seargent . \nas to how it stacks up to \" saving private ryan \" - it was my second favorite movie of 1998 , \" ryan \" was my first . \nit's really hard to compare the two - they are so , so different - so i won't , beyond saying that spielberg's film had more of an impact on me . \nhowever , the two are comparable from the standpoint of quality ( i can easily see why someone would \" the thin red line \" above \" ryan ) . \ni highly recommend both of them , and consider them to be the two best war movies ever made . \nall in all , \" the thin red line \" is filmmaking of an incredibly high order . \nit's slight faults are easily offset by the sheer brilliance of what is done right . \nit's a real shame that it tanked at the box office - films this unconventional , powerful , and thought-provoking don't come along very often . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": " \" the faculty , \" the heavily-hyped and advertised sci-fi/horror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez ( 1995's \" desperado \" and 1996's \" from dusk till dawn \" ) and screenwriter kevin williamson ( 1996's \" scream \" and 1997's \" scream 2 \" ) , is being called a cross between \" invasion of the body snatchers \" and \" the breakfast club , \" and i don't think i could describe it any better than that . \nthe film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common , and then the science-fiction aspect is added , involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town . \nthe six characters , as in \" the breakfast club , \" can be easily labeled as a stereotype , but as they are developed , they become far more complex : casey ( elijah wood ) , the much picked upon nerd ; stokely ( clea duvall ) , a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her ; zeke ( josh hartnett ) , a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz ; stan ( shawn hatosy ) , the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics ; delilah ( jordanna brewster ) , the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist ; and marybeth ( laura harris ) , the sweet 'n southern new girl in town . \nalthough the characters are only slightly connected ( i . e . \ncasey is delilah's photojournalist assistant ; marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely , since they both don't have friends , etc . ) , when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences , the only people they can count on for help is each other , even though they aren't really even sure if they can trust one another . \n \" the faculty \" is another smart and pop-culturally hip film from williamson , although it does not equal up to his best film , the original \" scream , \" and rodriguez , whose \" from dusk till dawn \" is still one of the more original genre films of the 90's . \nwilliamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions , respectively , that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no-brainer . \nthe plotline of \" the faculty , \" involving aliens taking over other people's bodies , has been done quite a lot before , from \" invasion of the body snatchers , \" to \" the puppet masters , \" to \" invaders from mars , \" so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh , and by setting the goings-on at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens , they were mostly successful . \nsurely , the conventions of the story are still the same , and the climax was inevitable , but there were a few surprises along the way , including the question of who were the aliens , and who weren't . \nthe epilogue was also a refreshing change-of-pace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better . \nthe performances in \" the faculty \" were a treat throughout , since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do . \none exception were the teens , who , aside from elijah wood , are not very well-known , but they all aquit themselves nicely , particularly wood ( the seasoned pro ) , clea duvall , and jordanna brewster . \nas members of the faculty , robert patrick ( \" t2 : judgement day \" ) was creepy as the gym coach ; piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher ; bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien ; and salma hayek , as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold , was very funny in a small role . \nthe standout , in my opinion , of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who , after turning into an alien , becomes the sex bombshell . \nif there was any problem i had with the faculty , it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence . \nsince the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the \" queen \" alien , many of the faculty members disappear . \nit might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers , although the finale is still pretty impressive , and includes some showstopping creature effects , especially for a relatively low 15-million-dollar budget . \nalthough not one of the best horror or science-fiction films i have seen , \" the faculty \" is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released . \nwhile the story is as old as the hills , it is also , in a way , timeless , because everyone , i think , has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right , as if they really weren't human . \nand by putting this idea in the setting of a small-town high school , it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers . \n+ note : the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading , as it features r & b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters . \nin actuality , he only has a small role as one of stan's buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team . \nif i were one of the heads from dimension , i would change this advertising at once , since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before . \nfor starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . \nto say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . \nthe book ( or \" graphic novel , \" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . \nin other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source . \nif you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes . \ngetting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? \nthe ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end . \nit's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called \" unfortunates \" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . \nwhen the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case . \nabberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . \nupon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach . \ni don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . \nin the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . \nit's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts .

sense when you see it . \nnow onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) . \nthe print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic . \noscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place . \neven the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent . \nians holm ( joe gould's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham . \ni cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it

the actual sequel : another 48 hours , a complete waste of film . \nbut , at last , someone has a different take on the matter , and it's director brett rainer . \nrush hour features jackie chan in his first u . s . action movie , playing a chinese detective who's being flown to the us to investigate the kidnapping of the chinese consulate's daughter . \nof course , the fbi is upset that he'll be interfering in their investigation , and stick him with an lapd office with a big mouth- of course , that's chris tucker . \nwhat makes rush hour work so damn well is the chemistry between the energetic chan and the absolutely hilarious tucker . \ntucker mouths off to chan at every given opportunity ( \" i'm michael jackson , you tito . \" ) , and chan delivers a few zingers of his own , as well as some terrific fight scenes . \nthe story's pretty much your average fare , but with a decent twist involving the main villain , a highly clouded figure named jun tao . \nat least it's entertaining , and the concept is excellently realized . \na particular fight scene in a chinese office , where chan and tucker duke it out with the bad guys , is funny and energetic at the same time . \nand the finale's a real treat as well . . . chan \ndelivers yet another fantastic stunt for the fans with a 10-story drop . \nrush hour is just the sort of film you'll get a kick out of on any

exploration , a chinese american computer engineer named fang ( peter wang ) decides to take a month-long vacation to visit his sister mrs . chao ( shen guanglan ) , her husband mr . chao ( hy

characters . \nopinion : sometimes a film is plot driven . \nsometimes it's a character sketch . \na great wall ( 1986 ) can be called a culture sketch , as opposed to a character sketch because it

probably shouldn't and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did . \n \" lucky numbers \" is a perfect example of this because it's such a blatant rip-off of \" fargo \" and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet it somehow still works for me . \ni know i'm in the minority here but let me explain . \nthe film takes place in harrisburg , pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter . \njohn travolta plays the local big-shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards . \nruss is married to crystal ( lisa kudrow ) , a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema . \nshe's a selfish , nasty bitch full of lust and desire but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl - not exactly the most intellectually taxing job on the market . \ncrystal's cheating on russ with their collective boss dick ( ed o'neil ) , the tv station manager . \nshe doesn't seem to genuinely like either of them , but it's all she can do in this one-horse town . \nmuch like \" fargo , \" this movie tells the story of a man who's going broke and has to pull off a huge scam to get rich quick . \nhe enlists the help of his english friend gig ( tim roth ) , the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery . \nalong the way a subplot involving a two-bit thug named , accurately , \" dale the thug \" ( michael rappaport ) gets mixed up in the process . \nthere's also a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down . \ni'm not going to elaborate much further on the plot and story because it continues to unwind and take twists and turns you're not expecting . \nthis is a farce , which is basically a straightforward , adult-oriented comedy but doesn't go as far as a classic black comedy should . \nwhere as \" fargo \" was sometimes shocking and disturbing while being funny , \" lucky numbers \" is just funny because you can't take these characters in these outrageous situations seriously . \nit's all a big cartoon basically , but it's funny and i can respect that . \ntravolta is great in his role and even though he's not a really likable character , he's trying to be a nice guy despite the fact he's a creep . \nhe's like a gangster with morals who genuinely feels sorry for the guys he has to kill . \ncrystal is just the opposite , she's constantly arguing and using whatever brain cells she has left to look out for herself . \nkudrow is perfect in this role since she's spent 8 years on tv as the dim-witted phoebe on \" friends . \" \nhere is character is basically a very evil incarnation of phoebe . \ni have to admit i was honestly surprised and pleased by how the plot unraveled and the methods each of the main characters use to try to get their share of the money . \nlike \" jackie brown , \" ( an elmore leonard adaption ) , the story is about a circle of 10 characters all after the lottery money that has been won illegally . \nthe screenplay does a fine job in balancing the characters and slowly revealing their motivations and hidden agendas while at the same time keep russ richards the main focus . \nmore and more characters are introduced and since the film has such an iconic , cartoony atmosphere you can take on faith just what makes the minor characters do what they do . \nthe ending itself is great . \nit's surprising and funny and makes you feel good . \nyou realize this film has packed in about 10 different movies' worth of stories into two hours' time and didn't fall apart ( although many other critics might beg to differ ) . \ni liked it , and i could see it again - isn't that what makes a movie good ? \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "warning : anyone offended by blatant , leering machismo had

getting together and producing a movie between arm-wrestling matches . \nthese films always contain male characters i have a very hard time identifying with , probably due to the likelihood that any meeting between them and me would result in my arm being ripped off and then my subsequent death by beating with said limb . \nand we got tough guys galore , here ; drug-running banditos by the dozens , all dirty and sweaty and pretty ill-tempered , overall ; a secret task force of army commandos who are in the area to cover-up ( supposedly ) any connection between the government and the drug runners ; and lots of shit-kicking texas dirt farmers who'd as soon shoot you between the eyes as look at you . \nin particular , we got nick nolte as one hard-ass texas ranger , powers boothe as the

reservoir dogs , is absolutely and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about , loved , and hated films of all-time . \nin all fairness , it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it . \nas if reservoir dogs wasn't perfect , tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction , a fast-paced , hard talking , roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way . \nevery major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor . \nto begin with , the two hit men : vincent vega ( john travolta ) and jules winnfield ( samuel l . jackson ) . \nthese two characters work together perfectly , and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect . \ntravolta , in fact , is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role . \nif these two characters were not enough , there's the struggling boxer butch coolidge ( bruce willis ) , the two small-time criminals pumpkin ( tim roth ) and honey bunny ( amanda plummer ) , the big man in charge marsellus wallace ( ving rhames ) and his attractive young wife mia ( uma thurman ) , and the \" problem solver \" himself , the wolf ( harvey keitel ) . \nthese are just the major characters . \nsmaller roles , but equally terrific , are handed to jimmie ( quentin tarantino ) , a young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business , lance ( eric stoltz ) , the far-out drug dealer , as well as maynard ( duane whitaker ) and zed ( peter greene ) , two hillbillies who are the men \" behind \" ( no pun intended for those of you who have seen this ) a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film . \nthe film interweaves three stories that , at first , seem to be nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other . \nthe film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and hold-ups . \nthe two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop , unknowing of what lies ahead . \nafter this , the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle . \nutilizing the films unforgettable dialogue , the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants . \nthe two men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss , marsellus wallace . \nafter basically toying with the men , especially the unfortunate brett ( frank whaley ) , vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase . \nthis is not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a . 357 \n \" hand cannon \" , shooting at the two gangsters . \nhe somehow completely misses them , leading jules to cite divine intervention . \nthis is also the basis for more of the now-famous tarantino dialogue . \nthe film then shifts to focus on boxer butch coolidge and his boxing escapades . \nbutch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight , but when he does not , marsellus vows to find him , wherever he is , and make sure that butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune . \nvincent , meanwhile , has the honor of taking marsellus' wife , mia , out on a date while the big man is out of town . \nvincent , obviously , is rather nervous about this , especially after hearing the tale about a man who was thrown out of a window for supposedly giving mia a foot massage . \nafter their date , which seems to rather smoothly , things take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincent's high-priced heroin , dubbed a \" monster \" by lance . \neach story continually progresses , and new and amazing events occur . \neventually , the stories all meet each other in the end , with pumpkin and honey bunny holding up the restaurant , which happens to contain both vincent and jules . \npulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade , and possibly of all-time . \nalong with its superb dialogue , action , writing , directing , and acting , this film will not only latch onto you , but it proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you . \nand with most fans of this movie , this is proved to be a rather easy task , although at times the graphic images , violence , and language may seem a bit overpowering . \nsurely , quentin tarantino's fame was greatly escalated by this film , and he proves not to be one who will fade from existence very soon . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files . \nfirst , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie . \nthe producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable . \nyou have to reach for a larger audience . \ntherefore , the movie is quite user-friendly . \naltough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange . \nbut fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on . \nyou will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera . \nin any case , the answer is no . \ni am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium . \nhowever , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie . \ni taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new . \neverything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others . \ni know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie . \nwarning : major spoilers follow ! \nplease do not read , to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird \" hummm \" sound is all about . \nyou have been warned . \nthe x-files is what a summer should be . \nexciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances . \nthis is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank . \nfrom start to finish , this movie does not let go of you . \nwhen i compare it with last summer's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon . \nthis flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes . \nin fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue . \nyou might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! \nthe last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid . \nyou know , when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? \nso yeah , the x-files is scary . \nand guess what ? \nyou never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster . \ndo not think that the x-files is a monster movie . \nin fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total . \nno , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series . \nscully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time . \nshe has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much . \nno , this is mulder's time in the spotlight . \nby now , you have heard of the scene where mulder \" showers \" independence day . \nif you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let's just say that due to recent events mulder should be \" showering \" godzilla instead . \nto those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who \ncares ! ? \nif he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? \nthe dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous . \nthe camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill . \nthe script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose . \nif you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! \nunlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects . \nmiss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense . \nalso , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . don't ! \nthe person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation . \nthere is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ? \n ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose . \nwho needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a \" big emotional scene \" between godzilla attacks ? \nso far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i'd recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose . \nbut the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is . \nwhat more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ? \ncool effects ? \nit's good some . \npulse pounding ? \nhell yes ! \nstrangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time . \nit does not provide answers to the show's many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together . \nrating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many \" whoah , i never saw that one coming ! \" \nmoments , four \" holy shit , where the hell did that come from \" and one heck of an ending . \nyou may wonder where this movie lost half a star . \nwell , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop . \nit's pretty obvious the film's makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "one of the best movies i've ever seen . \ni'd heard extremely good things about this movie , and though the previews didn't

satisfying movie experiences of the year . \nbruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe . \nat the beginning of the movie , he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work , but he is soon confronted by vincent , a patient malcolm failed years earlier ( donnie wahlberg-former new kid-in an impressive cameo ) . \na year passes , and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed . \ncole sear ( haley joel osment ) is a withdrawn kid who is called \" freak \" by the other boys in the neighborhood . \nweird things seem to happen around cole-his

shouldn't-for example , that there was once a gallows in his school . \nhe steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom . \nthe trailer gave away the movie's

reveals his secret : he sees ghosts everywhere . \ndead people wander around not knowing that they're dead , invisible to everyone except cole . \nmalcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth . \nthe box office success of \" the sixth sense \" has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why that's so . \ni hate to burst anybody's bubble , but \" the sixth sense \" isn't really a horror film . \nat its core , \" the sixth sense \" is a touching story of how a troubled kid and an emotionally-scarred adult help each other to move past their problems . \nsome scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy , though . \none that really got to me : the ghost of a boy says to cole , \" i'll show you where my dad keeps his gun \" ; when the ghost turns , we see the bullet wound in the back of his head . \nosment gives the best performance i've ever seen from a child actor . \nit's hard enough to find a

romantic comedy about a gay man who doesn't die of aids or wind up alone at the end . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": " \" dangerous beauty \" is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583 . \nit is beautifully filmed , wonderfully acted , and certainly nothing short of entertaining , but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness . \ndealing with themes of forbidden love , religious intolerance , subordination of women , sexual freedom , and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high-cultured society , it still feels like brightly lit fluff . \nthe director , marshall herskovitz , doesn't want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down , so he opts for a more genial , livelier , and relatively shallow interpretation . \nthe film takes place during the renaissance , a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe . \nat this time , venice was its own republic , and it thrived on being the central juncture of east-west commerce . \nthe film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice , so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived . \nhowever , there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes , their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment . \nthe story centers on veronica franco ( catherine mccormack ) , a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier ( rufus sewell ) , the son of wealthy aristocratic parents ( jeroen krabb ? and joanna cassidy ) . \nunfortunately , the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love -- rather , it was more like a business transaction , where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power , wealth , and ensure that outsiders couldn't get in . \nveronica , despite her charm and good looks , is certainly an outsider . \nafter a short love affair , marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her . \nhowever , because she is beautiful and intelligent , veronica has a chance to enter marco's world , albeit not as his wife . \nshe decides to become a courtesan -- a class of women who were as well-educated as they were ravishing , and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite . \na courtesan was not a mere prostitute ; they were afforded a special place in society , and they were greatly revered , respected , and often envied . \nat one point , a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants . \nveronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother , paola ( jacqueline bisset ) , who was once a famed courtesan herself . \nonce she enters the lifestyle , veronica finds that it suits her quite well . \nshe is allowed to read all the books she wants , she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry , and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet , including the awestruck marco . \ntheir relationship develops into a playful bantering , with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marco's advances . \nin many ways , their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love , and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to love . \n \" love the love , not the man , \" as her mother told her . \n \" dangerous beauty , \" which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal , flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice . \nit has multiple plot lines -- including veronica's adversarial relationship with a court poet ( oliver platt ) , her role in obtaining france's military assistance in venice's battle against the turks , and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition -- yet it is never confusing or overbearing . \nmuch of the film's success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role . \nknown chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson's ire in \" braveheart \" ( 1995 ) , mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of a leading lady . \nshe has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a courtesan ; her character is intelligent , witty , and both sensual and vulnerable , all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes . \nthe rest of the roles are also filled well , including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in \" dark city \" have assured him a solid place in hollywood . \nhe has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta , and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas . \noliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like a second skin , although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy . \nplatt is a good actor , but he's just too hard to hate . \njacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was , and even fred ward turns up in a small , but moving performance as marco's uncle . \n \" dangerous beauty \" is marshall herskovitz's sophomore directorial effort , after the overlooked 1993 film \" jack the bear . \" \npartnered with edward zwick , herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television ( \" thirtysomething , \" \" my so-called life \" ) and in the movies ( \" legends of the fall \" ) . \nhis directing style can be best described as transparent -- it never gets in the way of the story , yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions . \nhe could have approached the film in any number of ways , including overdosing on the sexual aspect , which he wisely avoids . \n \" dangerous beauty \" contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic , but not so much that it seems exploitative . \nherskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew , including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli , whose previous efforts include the highly-stylized thriller \" kalifornia \" ( 1993 ) and abel ferrara's dark sci-fi film \" body snatchers \" ( 1994 ) . \nbazelli captures the film in strong , bold colors , and be brings sixteenth-century venice to life in wide , panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery . \nhowever , the real details are found in the production design by norman garwood ( \" brazil , \" \" the princess bride \" ) and the costumes by gabriella pescucci ( \" the age of innocence \" ) . \nthe only problem with \" dangerous beauty \" is that it doesn't stick with you . \nit's a good story well-told with interesting characters , but it's easy to shrug off once you've left the theater . \nthe only sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions , but it never quite comes off because it's simply too melodramatic and conventional . \nherskovitz tries with all his might to make it a nailbiter , but somehow its outcome is a foregone conclusion , and like the rest of the film , it carries no real weight , despite the potential severity of the subject matter . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": " \" the end of the affair \" is a dark and moody romantic period piece , that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs . \nalthough it's slow and sometimes confusing to follow , it still manages to give audiences a moving experience . \nbased on graham greene's novel of the same name , the film mainly follows 3 characters . \nthere's maurice bendrix ( ralph fiennes ) who has an affair with henry mile's ( stephen rea ) wife sarah ( julianne moore ) . \nsarah finds henry to be a bore , because well , he's just a normal guy . \nit's all work and no play with him . \nwhile maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah , and would do anything for her . \nunfortunately the two break up . \nthis is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks , so that leads us to the present . \nit's a few years later , and they both still think of each other , so maurice hires a private detective ( ian hart ) to see what sarah is up too . \nwhile this may sound straight forward it's not . \nit's a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men ,

can see why . \nthe story was also well written thanks to neil jordan . \neven though i didn't read the book , there's no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive . \nwhat's so moving about it you ask ? \nthe tragedy of it all . \nit's not the typical romance , in which a guy finds a girl , they fall in love and all is well , this is more complicated and depressing . \nit really shows the complexity of a relationship , because nothing is ever perfect . \neveryone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces . \nback to neil jordan's script , it wasn't only red roses . \nthere were times when i felt it too be a little slow , but most romances are . \nit also tended to be a bit confusing , especially at the start . \nit keep jumping around from past to present , so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things . \nalso a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan . \ni'd have to say this is his finest achievement to date , because quite frankly i've never really found his work to be up to par . \nit just never did anything for me , until now . \nwhen it ends , it leaves viewers a little saddened , but provoked nonetheless . \nthis is

into a movie , directed by mike nichols , and , in light of recent presidential scandals , seems to be more relevant than ever . \nbut the film is more than a diatribe against , or a paean in praise of , the president . \nit is a fascinating look at the political machinery , and the ethical quagmire , that surround modern politics . \njack stanton ( john travolta ) is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination . \nhe is charismatic , but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign , and strains his relationship with his wife , susan ( emma thompson ) . \nthe film is told from the point of view of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , grandson of a civil rights leader , who is swept away by stanton's ideals and helps to organize the campaign . \nhe joins political strategist richard jemmons ( billy bob thornton , looking an awful lot like james carville ) , and campaign advisor daisy green ( maura tierney ) . \ngovernor stanton's past repeatedly pops up to haunt him , a fact that his chief rival , lawrence harris ( kevin cooney ) , consistently uses to his advantage . \nto help clean up the stanton campaign , jack and susan

thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can't let anything show that might hurt the presidential run . \nthe problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other , or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom . \nprimary colors treads lightly on this issue . \nthough stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat , and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans , the movie touches on few actual political issues . \nin fact , most of the \" bad guys \" are fellow democrats on the

difficult to completely separate it from reality ( particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the president's current troubles ) . \nprimary colors' chief problem is its length . \nit runs about 15 minutes too long . \nthere are some scenes which could have easily been cut . \nfor example , midway through the film , the candidate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists .

ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy , buzz and the boys invade al's toy barn , where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesn't know he's a toy . \nthe new buzz generates the movie's biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on \" zurg's fortress \" ( i . e . , al's apartment building ) . \nthe original \" toy story \" won me over because its central themes reflected a grown-up sensibility rather than the usual this-is-what-we-think-kids-want-to-hear . \nwhile most kids' movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill , in \" toy story \" buzz discovered that he wasn't special , that he was just like everyone else . \nbuzz sank into a suicidal depression , but woody showed buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy makes a child happy . \nin other words , it's okay to be ordinary if you have love and a purpose in your life . \nmost of us probably come to the same conclusion when we realize that we're not space rangers and we're never going to be . \n \" toy story 2 \" addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the first movie . \nwoody is forced to recognize that andy will grow up and forget him and that he will likely be discarded , abandoned , or sealed up in a dark box in the attic . \nthis is another big grown-up theme : everything ends . \nthe theme is introduced early in the movie when woody's arm is torn and andy places him on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp . \non the shelf , woody meets wheezy , who's dusty , broken , and forgotten . \nthe other toys are shocked that woody has been \" shelved , \" and they worry that woody's ride out to the 25-cent box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt . \nafter he's stolen , woody has to decide between a long life in a display case and an uncertain future with andy and his pals . \nof course , in spite of the heavy themes \" toy story 2 \" explores , it's also very funny . \nmost of the laughs come from the toys' assault on al's toy barn and on the apartment building . \nthe brief substitution of a new , still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise ; i'd wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original . \nmost of the vocal performances are first-rate . \ntom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work . \nhowever , one voice-over also stands out as horribly miscast . \nkelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector . \nalthough he does a lot of voice-over work in commercials and on \" the simpsons \" ( as sideshow bob ) , grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice . \nhe doesn't have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete . \nthe animation is even better than in the first . \nespecially impressive were the textures of the figures . \nwe can now see the difference between flesh and plastic ; in the first movie the people looked just like the toys , but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint . \nwe can also see that bo peep is porcelain . \nas you can tell from the long-winded phrasing

. \nand of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery , the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie & clyde to natural born killers . \nbut if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction , exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run , normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon . \n \" inspired by true events \" -- we've heard that one before , and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated . . . \nor so strangely poignant . \nfor this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality , who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged . \nbeginning with their final arrest , the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris ( luke perry ) , a policeman , and pam ( ashley judd ) , a factory worker . \nthey fall in love and marry , but pam's increasingly erratic behaviour ( going on spending sprees , slashing herself with a knife after an argument ) begin to trouble the solid and stable chris . \nwhen chris gets sacked , they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up . \nthen , chris begins to rob banks . . . \nluke perry accomplishes the not-inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer . \nmoustached , with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation , he is perfectly cast as the long-suffering husband . \n ( it's another of john mcnaughton's coups of casting-against-type , after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory ) . \nbut it is the character of pam who commands centrestage , and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness , making pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating person . \nif the performance falls short of greatness , however , it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema , whether it's in betty blue , tom & viv or georgia . \nas in those movies , there's the danger that the performance seems mannered , a collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece . \njudd doesn't entirely avoid this pitfall , but pam's 'craziness' is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more 'normal' chris . \nwhen pam reacts to her father-in-law's death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones , chris' face is the picture of pained restraint . \nof course , it's the question of what is 'normal' that is asked in normal life . \nmcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity . \nit is the rational chris that loves guns ( \" shooting is about precision , control \" ) and the 'crazy' pam that loves astronomy and yearns for a dog ( who is then called chaos -- \" chaos and you and me . . . \nwe're a real family \" , she notes wryly ) . \nit is chris' methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a successful bank robber ( his well-planned disguise as a bearded , roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness ) . \nin the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery , a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out in the background : \" buy-more \" -- the perfectly respectable consumption-crazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases , and both of them into desperate situations . \nit's not a perfect film . \nsome of the dialogue is a touch too banal ( perhaps intentionally ? ) . \nthe use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pam's crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film . \nindeed , as in mcnaughton's seminal film henry : portrait of a serial killer , it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism , the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre , that gives this determinedly unflashy , moving film its great strengths . \nmcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet , coolly 'realistic' method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer . \nthe suburbs , with their miles of white-fenced houses and identikit malls , take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness . \nin its

\nis it fate that keeps them near each other and ultimately puts them together ? \ndoes this predestination carry over to all aspects of life ? \nas the film starts , erin castleton ( hope davis ) , a melancholy 29- year old late shift nurse , is ending her live-in relationship with her boyfriend ( hoffman ) . \nrather , he is ending it with her . \narriving home from work , erin finds her boyfriend parked in front of their apartment , car packed with his belongings . \nin a fumbling , amusing and self deluding ramble , he instructs erin to watch a videotape he's made detailing why their relationship is doomed to fail and why he's leaving . \nit's obvious he lacks the courage to confront her directly as he rails on about accomplishing something with his life and taking a stand , all the while backpedaling his way out of their relationship . \nhe then flees the scene with the grace of an inept thief . \nerin's mother ( holland taylor , in a surprisingly effective , small role ) , fearing that her daughter will be without a man in her life , takes out a personal ad for erin . \nto erin's embarrassed horror , the ad describes her as a \" frisky , cultured , carefree professional with a zest for life \" . \neventually , erin responds to the tidal wave of responses , which makes for some of the most humorous , telling moments of the movie as she meets prospective

goggles , he follows erin from window to window , separated by the glass as erin , oblivious to his gaze , enjoys the fish . \nlater , we see him on a train as she sits on a platform outside , mere feet away . \nthe movie spends it's entirety having their paths circle each other without crossing . \nthere are several subplots involving alan . \none concerns his attempts to get on the job track at the boston aquarium , thereby escaping his apparent fate to carry on the family plumbing business . \nanother subplot involves his father's desperate attempts to force fate's hand by gambling away his life at the dog track . \na distracting focus is put on alan's debt to a loan shark and the manner in which he pays it off . \nthe movie tries too hard to make alan a likable guy . \nthankfully , his dream- guy persona is counterbalanced by erin's distant , yet fundamentally hopeful , personality . \nthe film moves along at an unhurried pace , albeit too much so in the latter third , as we wait for the two to meet . \nco-writers anderson and lyn vaus throw a couple of possible red herrings into the mix as the two find other possible relationships . \nthe films shifts into a much slower gear as we wait for these romances to blow over . \nwhen alan and erin eventually do meet , we see that perhaps they both were destined for each other as they share a lingering , almost subliminally knowing , gaze . \nit's a sweet , measured moment . \nthe disappointment comes in the fact that we've come to know the pair , yet we don't get to view their impending romance . \nthe film's inherent

very different from the one depicted in hollywood movies . \nthat is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find , to their big surprise , that the majority of people vote republican , go to church every sunday and usually don't tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film . \nsuch rude awakening , however , can happen in another direction - conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in . \nsomething like that happens to jake van dorn ( george c . scott ) , successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community . \none day his daughter kristen ( ilah davis ) disappears from calvinist youth convention in california . \nvan dorn is worried because he doesn't believe that his daughter would run from home . \nhowever , the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast ( peter boyle ) is even harder - kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film . \ninfuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way mast's investigation is going , so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself . \nunfortunately , he lacks experience and the quest , that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld , is fruitless . \nthings change when he devises cunning plan and , while doing it , stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky ( season hubley ) . \nalmost two decades after its release , hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars . \nit is a real shame , because very few movies in today's hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt . \nin late 1970s , it was totally different situation - films were expected to have mature , serious themes for the mature audience . \nfor schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work , taxi driver - one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in 1970s . \non one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great . \nbut that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and , instead of facing them , prefers to live in rural , conservative cocoons . \nthe new america , on the other hand , fares no better - ideals of the so-called \" sexual revolution \" , same as all other \" revolutions \" of the swinging sixties , degraded into exploitation and depravity . \ninstead of being \" liberated \" , baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms . \nschrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas , actually , aren't so far away - nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn , already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist , meets sleazy porno producer ; the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian , paternalistic and very dedicated to this job . \nthe difference between the two is simply in the line of work . \nmany contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda . \non the surface , it may look that way - audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest . \nin the first scenes , he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesn't deserve to experience parent's worst nightmare . \nthe scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristen's fate is extremely cruel ; pain and humiliation , brought by oscar-winning actor george c . scott , is of such intensity , that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda . \nvan dorn is perhaps flawed , and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end ; but the viewers simply know that his cause is just , and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body . \non the other hand , schrader , who grew up in an environment very much like van dorn's ( his own parents wouldn't allow him to watch movies until he was 18 ) , knows better and tries to bring another side of coin . \neven the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities - like nicky , who actually tries to improve her life , and sleazy detective who develops something like a conscience at the end . \nunfortunately , schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning , and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich ? d finale . \nthe script is slightly flawed , and schrader as director doesn't show too much originality - his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver . \napart from the scenes in grand rapids , those two films even look alike . \nbut the content might be more than interesting for today's viewer , especially those inspired by the current 70s revival . \nuntil boogie nights , no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in 1970s . \nhardcore , on the other hand , might serve as precious document , because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs - before the advent of video , when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists . \nthe view of such age and the industry is very unflattering , though , but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience , that shouldn't be too surprising . \nanyway , despite some flaws , hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of

little that's special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path , leaves the audience with a warm , fuzzy feeling , and never really challenges or surprises us . \nbut it's intelligently written ( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant ) , strongly directed , and nicely acted . \nso , while good will hunting is far from a late-year masterpiece , it's a worthwhile sample of entertainment . \nlike scent of a woman , which was released around this time of the season five years ago , good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world-weary veteran and a cocky young man . \nthe formula for the two films is similar -- both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it -- but the characters are different . \nal pacino's slade was a larger-than-life individual ; robin williams' sean mcguire is much more subtle . \nand matt damon's will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris o'donnell's charlie . \nwill is a troubled individual . \nas a child , he was the frequent victim of abuse . \nan orphan , he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis . \nnow , not yet 21 years old , he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet . \nhe has a short temper and any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box . \nbut he's a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems . \nwhile working as a janitor at mit , he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building's hall blackboards . \nthen , one evening , his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) catches him at work . \nwill flees , but lambeau tracks him down . \nunfortunately , by the time the professor finds him , will is in jail for assaulting a police offer . \nthe judge agrees to release will under two conditions : that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist . \neventually , once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man , sean mcguire , a teacher at bunker hill community college , agrees to take the case . \nafter a rocky start , the two form a rapport and will begins to explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor . \nand , as will advances his self-awareness in sessions with sean , he also learns about friendship from his buddy , chuckie ( ben affleck ) , and love from a harvard co-ed named skylar ( minnie driver ) . \nthe script , by co-stars matt damon and ben affleck , is not a groundbreaking piece of literature , and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation . \nthe characters are well-developed , however , and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles . \nat one point , will comments that a session with sean is turning into a \" taster's choice moment . \" \nlater , will gives a brilliant , breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith . \n ( note : since smith co-executive produced good will hunting , it's not out of the question that he had some input into this scene . ) \ndirector gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , to die for ) culls genuine emotion from his actors , and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes . \nthere's an edginess to some of the sean/will therapy sessions , and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver ( who became romantically linked while making this film ) translates effectively to the movie -- the will/skylar relationship is electric . \nlikewise , the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie's friendship . \nmany of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation , even if the overall story is somewhat generic . \nmatt damon , who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker , is solid ( although not spectacular ) as will . \nminnie driver ( last seen in grosse pointe blank ) adds another strong performance to a growing resume ( and it's refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one ) . \nthe outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams , whose sean is sad and wise , funny and somber . \narguably the best dramatic work in the actor's career ( alongside what he did in the fisher king ) , williams' portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination . \nadequate support is provided by ben affleck ( chasing amy ) and stellan skarsgard ( breaking the waves ) . \nlike most of what comes before it , the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable . \nbut meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren't always bad things in a movie , provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail . \ngood will hunting does both , and , as a result , earns a rating commensurate with the \" good \" in the title . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "written by john grisham and robert altman ( as al hayes ) \ndirected by robert altman \nsome time ago , a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel . \nthe novel was a summer smash , topping best-seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads . \nthe only problem : the novel wasn't very good . \nit was far more pulp than pulitzer . \nbut the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller . \nso he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen . \nthe director ? \nfrancis ford coppola . \nthe book , of course , was mario puzo's the godfather . \nthe rest , as they say in showbiz , was history . \nby bringing up the godfather , i don't mean to suggest that robert altman's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness . \nbut the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material . \ncan you get any more questionable than john grisham ? \ndepends on whom you ask . \nbut there's no question that grisham's work grabs people . \nlike puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who can't tell a well-constructed story from a can of spam . \nso something in grisham's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america's greatest living filmmakers . \nthe result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon . \n>from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe . \nthis terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch . \nwitness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear . \nwe roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone . \nright away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises . \npay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by john grisham , but by altman . \nthis is what a great director can do for questionable source material . \nthe sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases . \nmagruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office . \noutside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen . \ndriven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home . \nthere he learns more about mallory's life than he bargained for . \nher car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski-style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter . \nmagruder , perhaps influenced by mallory's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed - right after he sleeps with her , of course . \nthis simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end . \nhe succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital , and for a moment all appears well . \nbut then dixon's crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly magruder finds himself , mallory and his own children in danger . \nthe cops won't lift a finger to help a liberal attorney . \nhis only allies are his faithful assistant lois ( daryl hannah ) and his bumbling private-eye sidekick clyde ( robert downey jr ) . \nif this predicament wasn't bad enough , hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos . \naltman may provide the atmosphere , but branagh's performance holds the gingerbread man together . \nan accomplished actor when he isn't directing himself in vanity productions , branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives . \nis his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness , or of egotism ? \nmagruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by then it's too late . \nas the plot unfolds , magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are . \nand life is never so bad that it can't get worse . \nif you're familiar with altman's work , you'll recognize several of his signature techniques . \ncharacters are not introduced in establishing shots , but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent . \ncrucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows , making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action . \ndialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style . \nand of course there's my favorite altman technique - the obligatory nude actress shot . \nthanks to altman , here are some of the actresses i've had the pleasure of seeing naked : sally kellerman , julianne moore , madeline stowe , even frances mcdormand . \nand now i can add embeth davidtz , who looks quite healthy in the altogether . \nthe naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film . \nis it old-school sexism , or a clever in-joke ? \nyou be the judge . \nbut back to the picture at hand . \nin the hands of a mere mortal , the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller , no better or worse than the countless others we've all endured . \nin the hands of a master like altman , it becomes an exercise in existential doom , in its own way far more successful than scorsese's cape fear remake , which tried for the same result . \nwhat may prevent it from enduring with altman's greatest work is a weak third act - in fact , there really is no third act in grisham's story , so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up . \nbut there are true moments of riveting suspense , and great performances by branagh , davidzt and downey jr - more than enough to see you through . \nthat polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman , and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back , should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are . \nthey probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill . \nand that , my friends , should make you very afraid . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "uncompromising french director robert bresson's \" lancelot of the lake \" achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory's \" morte darthur . \" \ninstead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table , it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak , ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous , bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them . \nchivalry has no place in \" lancelot of the lake , \" except as that of a dying ideal . \nbresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning , decimated , after failing merlin's command to retrieve the holy grail , the mystical cup that was filled with christ's blood . \nbresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest : bloodshed and failure . \nthe opening sequence is a series of clumsy , disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights -- a head is hacked off , a stomach is impaled , a skull is split open , skeletal remains hang from trees , and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house . \nsince the film starts with camelot in near-ruin , and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion , it doesn't carry the grand , tragic resonance of other arthurian films . \nwe never get to see camelot at the peak of its power , therefore there is no real downfall to witness . \nbut , then again , it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film . \nrather , it is lancelot , and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart , than the external downfall of a kingdom . \nlancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales , and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh . \nthe greatest of all knights , he was flawed only in his love for arthur's wife , queen guinevere , and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot . \neven when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere ( laura duke condominas ) , he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment . \nhe knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom , but he is powerless in his passion . \nwhen sir mordred ( patrick bernhard ) accuses lancelot of the affair , other knights , including sir gawain ( humbert balsan ) spring to lancelot's defense . \nit is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table ; the flesh wins out over the spirit , and the consequences are dire . \nbresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men's hearts and minds . \n \" lancelot of the lake \" is filled with his particular trademarks : a stripped-down , minimalist style , flat , expressionless dialogue , and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music . \nhe uses background music only twice in the film , during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits . \nthe music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes , but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film's thematic elements : the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor , the neighing of horses , the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads , and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest . \nlike most of his other films , bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless , flat voices . \nall the actors he used in \" lancelot of the lake \" had never acted before , and with the exception of patrick bernhard , they never acted again . \nnever once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word . \ninstead of using vocal inflection , bresson strove to create emotion through images . \nin some ways , this technique works ; in other ways , it doesn't . \nthe final montage of arthur's men battling each other is quite marvelous , and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap-pile sums up the entire film in one moment . \nhowever , other times bresson's uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable . \nfor instance , during an important jousting contest , bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses' legs . \nhe does this repeatedly , opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag . \nwhile there might be symbolic value in this , the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome . \nnevertheless , \" lancelot of the lake \" is a fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by a master filmmaker . \nbresson's style may not be for everyone , but one has to respect his strength as an artist . \nby re-evaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own , he turns \" lancelot of the lake \" into something rare in modern cinema : a truly personal film . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "it's been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller , where

custody of paxton . \nthe possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse : a ) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities ; b ) they could try to fight off the rightful owners , who are either villainous or just ; or c ) they could fight amongst themselves . \n \" a simple plan , \" though borrows a little from each of these . \na little tiff with the cops here , a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent ( a chilling gary cole ) there ) , and a bit of inside feuding over here . \nbut , as austin powers would say , that's not necessarily its bag ( baby ) . \nwhat i most admired about this film , and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it's successfully able to have its cake and eat it too . \nit effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches , like the ones mentioned above , but at the same time , it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag . \nso while steps are taken to neatly cover things up , and these subsequent steps go miserably awry , the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to , they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity . \nin one early scene , paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn't look like it was all stolen ( not a bad idea ) , when thornton screws up ( as he does continuously throughout the movie ) , and paxton has to do some major covering-up ( read : homicide ) . \ninstead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands-washing , raimi shows a lengthy , painful shot from a low-angle onto paxton's face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion . \nthere's a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he's committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective , but the previous shot is even better : more morally complex and more gut-wrenching . \nin short , probably the best piece of direction raimi's ever done , demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results ( for further proof , watch \" persona \" 's \" sex scene \" and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman's ever done ) . \nbut the film hardly stops here ; it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof . \nyet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story . \nwhen the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical ( with aid from his pregnant wife , played by bridget fonda , a pal to raimi ) , he does , and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights . \nthere's at least two grand shootouts , and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history , and when they arrive , they don't come with masochistic delight but with cringe-inducing horror . \nduring the one , i was actually sinking into my chair , with the mantra \" they can't do this , can they ? \" \nstreeming through my head . \nin fact , this film , which is getting many comparisons to the coen's [superior , but forget about it] \" fargo , \" has many similar moments of manic insanity , attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what , in other hands , would be over-the-top distractedness ( imagine , i suppose , robert rodriguez directing this . . . then \nagain , after seeing the \" evil dead \" films , i'd hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off , although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed \" raimi \" moments , a rifle-shot notwithstanding ) . \ninstead , raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch , easily letting the story and characters co-exist , while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out , like some offbeat comic touches . \nmost particularly , billy bob thornton's character , jacob , is a brilliant creation . \nhis dim-wittedness is often hilarious ( for most of the film , every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter ) , but there's authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we're not totally laughing at him . \nthe chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full-condescension because thornton is so damn real . \njacob's a multi-dimensional character , and while being stupid , we see that as not so much a flaw , but a strength to his character : his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system , primarily towards the middle where his bud and co-conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money . \nthe final third of the film spends much time with him , and many of the touches upon his character , not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b . smith ( adapting his own book , by the way ) are just great . \ni particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend , told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near-sweetness and further strength of his saddened character . \nthornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance , by far the best performance he's ever given and further proof that he's the best character actor in contemporary cinema ( if you don't believe me , go back and watch his wonderful performance in \" primary colors , \" a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn't been in the same year ) because he's easily able to slip into a character , and make him completely and utterly believable . \nhe brings so much weight to the film that , as it is with most character actors , it's difficult picturing anyone else in the role . \nthe rest of the cast is great too , from paxton's declining working man to chelcie ross' amiable town sheriff . \neven fonda shows off her talents nicely . \nand if i had any complaints about the film , it's that the plot is almost too simplistic , and that at times , it seems too much like an exercise , like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved . \nand the occasional narration is , as it usually is , annoying ( narration should be used with extreme caution , especially when you're trying to set things up and/or express emotions - didn't raimi watch the first murder scene ? ) . \nand , the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie , the ending is basically amiss . \ni won't reveal it , but it's way too cruel and too much of an outsider set-up , as if the appearance of a plane wasn't already too much of that anyway . \nfor a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved , this is the wrong ending . \nimagine a character-controlled ending ; otherwise , it's like if in \" crime and punishment \" if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing . . . not that i'm at all comparing \" a simple plan \" to dostoevsky . \nthe ending does work , despite my protestations , but to me , there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it ; but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it , then just ignore me and go about your day . \nbut despite my mere claims , make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout , and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured , not because of any kind of gore factor ( which is , thankfully for this , very minimal ) , but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that i've frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile . \nat least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": " \" i'd rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell , \" earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher . \nwith that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister , hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story . \nhe will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american , and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation . \nfrom elmer gantry on , we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church . \nwell , think again , for the apostle , which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade , does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister , and by implication all , the rest of organized religion . \ninstead it gives us a highly devout man , who certainly has his foibles , but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god . \nand arguably just as surprising , the good-spirited film is no comedy , even if it does have humorous moments . \ninstead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures . \nwhen in the privacy of his attic , robert duvall , as texas preacher euliss \" sonny \" dewey , argues sternly with his lord , the scene shares a kinship with emily watson's character crying out for her god in breaking the waves's most powerful scene . \nthe body of the story starts with sonny's coming upon an horrific auto accident , which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters . \nwith his well worn bible in hand , sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accident's dying victims . \nthe scowling police officer orders him to go away , and , after he has tried to work his miracles , sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord's work . \nrobert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film's director , writer , executive producer , and chief financier . \nrarely has a movie been such a labor of love . \nwith a white suit , peach-colored shirt and tie , and dark sunglasses , sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher . \nduvall has every movement down pat . \neven when he is walking down the street , the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy . \nhe dances and claps all the way . \nsonny's churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep-voiced black orators , but his rhetoric is always competitive . \n \" i may be on the devil's hit-list , but i'm on god's mailing list , \" he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent . \nand they lap it up . \npeople jump up , scream , \" praise the lord ! \" \nand mean it . \nthe intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable . \nbut sonny is no saint . \nit turns out that he has a wandering eye , which angers his wife jessie , played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett . \njessie gets her revenge by taking up with the church's youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonny's church , leaving him unemployed . \nsonny , letting his temper get the best of him , does something foolish , which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever . \nthe bulk of the film occurs in a small , predominately black church in louisiana , which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church ( \" one way road to heaven : holiness temple \" ) with an enthusiastic flock . \nin this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e . f . the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church . \nhe asks his members to tithe , but he gives all of his money . \nand his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks . \na man who can't stand to be still , he tells one of his friends , \" i quit school because i didn't like recess . \" \nin his new town he meets toosie ( miranda richardson ) , who , like him , has a family that she hasn't seen in a while . \nhis romance with the separated woman , like the rest of the film , doesn't follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies . \nbilly bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker . \nhis confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show's many surprising scenes , again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take . \nalthough it probably couldn't have ended any other way , the movie does wrap things up nicely . \nand don't miss the sweet epilogue during the film's closing credits . \na tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film . \nthe apostle runs a little too long at 2 : 12 . \nit is rated pg-13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close-up of a blank movie screen at a drive-in . \nwe hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses' hooves . \nwithout an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind's eye . \neven without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema . \nbut do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ? \nexploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept . \nis the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ? \nmidnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth . \nas joe buck migrates from place to place , he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself , only further degeneration . \nduring the opening credits , joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne : the alamo . ' \nas joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show , a lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper ? but he's dead . ' \na troubled expression comes across joe's face , as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone . \nhaving adopted the image of a cowboy since youth , joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody . \njoe's persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream . \nhe romanticizes about making it in the big city , but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance . \nby the end of midnight cowboy , joe buck loses everything and gains nothing . \njust as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen , we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success . \nbut how realistic are these ideals ? \njoe had raped and been raped in texas . \nthe scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york , but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas . \nalongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation . \nthe ability to pack up one's belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention . \nschlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe's abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny . \nwe understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy , a symbol of virility and gallantry , as an attempt to neutralize his shame . \nhe runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york . \nin the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe's encounter with the gay student , joe buck spills ketchup on himself . \nstanding up , we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh . \nschlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe's virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals , signifying emasculation . \nbeyond the symbol of castration , the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin's first sexual encounter , a reference to joe's first homosexual liaison . \nthe fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe's emasculation . \nit is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients , but effortlessly attracts men . \njoe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity ; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff . ' \nthere are two predominant images of new york . \nthe first is that new york is the rich , cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty . \nthe other new york is travis bickle's new york , a seedy , corruptive hell on earth . \njoe envisions new york as the former , but is presented with the latter . \nmirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine , he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men . \njoe thinks he is performing a great service for new york , but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions . \nthe people steal joe's money , the landlord confiscates his luggage , and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity . \nwhat has become of joe's american dream ? \nschlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party . \njoe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food , drugs , and sex . \nat the party , all of joe and ratzo's desires are made flesh ; joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami . \ncontrasting joe's daily struggles , shots of warhol's crew display wanton indulgence . \nthere is an irreverence in the partygoers' attitude ; we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular , orgies breaking out in the periphery , and drugs passed around like party favors . \nthe party makes a mockery of joe' s ideals . \njoe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america ; scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe's toils . \nthe american dream , schlesinger suggests , is merely a proletarian fantasy , for those who are content no longer dream , but become indolent . \nas joe heads to miami , all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him . \nhis masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished . \nfor joe , nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately , he surrenders the identity . \ntossing his boots into the garbage , he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami . \nthe final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus , more introspective , taking only a few glances outside the window . \ninstead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york , schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe . \nreflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus' window with joe hardly taking notice . \nthe scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before . \nthe world seems smaller to joe now ; the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream . \nno longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo ; he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means . \nmidnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream . \nthere is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians , you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family . \nthen there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock , with perseverance , can make a fortune in the big city . \njoe's attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york . \nduring his search for an intangible paradise , joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man . \nan allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream , joe buck's progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "for those of us who weren't yet born when the 1960's rock 'n' rolled around , monterey pop

\nof course , that doesn't mean that i'm gonna be giving this a four-star review or something , because \" alien : resurrection , \" the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is not an absolutely amazing film , much like the first two were . \nhowever , it's a very good film which never fails to entertain , and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series . \nin short , i had a good time . \n \" alien : resurrection \" leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre's answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one . \nof course , the last one wasn't very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn't financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! ) . \nso back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that's a bad thing , but it's becoming a cliche ) . \nso she's cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called \" the auriga \" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr . wren , played by j . e . freeman , as well as the little-seen dr . gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her . \nonce you get past the fact that you can't figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film's okay . \nalso on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and . . . winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won't state it , but unless you've been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it's nicely covered up ) . \nthere's a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it's never really deepened enough . \noh well . \nwell , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship . \nand it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who's death is comical yet sad since , well , he's dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth . \nof course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old \" alien \" -brand fun . \nthe real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there's always a bit of it , most notably in \" aliens \" with the relationship between ripley and the little girl ) . \nwhat's interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach . \n \" alien \" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights . \n \" aliens \" is a wild , tense thriller . \n \" alien 3 \" is a bleak , moody piece of semi-noir . \n \" alien 4 \" is kind of like an off-beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares . \njean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like \" das boot \" has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat . \nthe chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there's the most tense surgery scene since \" face/off \" towards the beginning ) . \nand not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that . \nthis all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others . \nthere are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed . \none is the aforementioned surgery scene . \nanother one takes place between call and ripley , which is just awesome . \nthe underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw-dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet's earlier film , \" delicatessen \" ) . \nand the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to \" goldfinger \" ) . \nbut the best scene in the entire film ( i'm sure i'm not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an \" 8 \" tatooed on her arm ) . \nit might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga . \nthe screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work , as it never really deapens a lot of the characters . \nhowever , it does make us care about most of them , so that when there's very little of them , and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow , we are pretty scared . \nand , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley : \" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! \" \njohner : \" well , i can get you off . \nbut not this ship . \" ) \nthe acting is good all around , with stand-out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner , and leland orser ( the poor bastad in \" se7en \" who performed the \" lust \" sin ) as an anxiety-ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him . \nwinona ryder is good , but not amazing like she usually is ( although she meshes well with the film ) . \nof course , and as usual , sigourney weaver steals the show . \nplaying a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional , and more rude and bitter ) , she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable . \nshe's not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for \" aliens , \" but she's just awesome . \noverall , it's a thrilling , entertaining film which doesn't really amaze like the first two , but is much more amazing than the third installment . \nthe style is the best part of the film , which isn't really a bad thing , but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply . \nbut it's entertaining as hell , and it's definitely fit for the \" alien \" series

new roman \" \\ s 10 \\ h} for his performance in the movie ) . \nverbal is so-named because he frequently rambles on about anything or nothing . \nhe also earns his name as the movie's narrator , spouting memorable lines like \" the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist \" ( although , obviously , he does exist -- what else could explain kris kross having a comeback in 1996 ? ) while being interrogated by police detective chazz palminteri ( any actor with multiple z's in their name is okay in my book ) . \nwe see the story unfold as spacey retells it . \nthe five felons , upon being released from the lineup , get their revenge on the police by exposing a corrupt taxi service -- whereby elite criminals pay to be smuggled through town in cop cars -- and stealing all the money and drugs in the car . \nit's a definite case of male bonding for the five criminals , who later find out they were brought together by the unseen keyser soze , who sends a minion to them with an offer they can't refuse . \nnamely , they have to destroy soze's main competitors in organized crime by infiltrating a ship , shooting a bunch of people , burning all the drugs and stealing $91 million cash . \nspacey does a terrific job of bringing his seemingly unintelligent \" cripple \" character to life and baldwin , byrne , palminteri and the rest make for a good supporting cast . \nthe usual suspects is one of those movies that deftly mixes scenes of violence and explosions with an underlying sense of mystery and suspense , keeping the viewer guessing until the very end -- and then still leaving a few details open for scrutiny and discussion . \ni suppose all that would be cleared up if i really had rewound the movie and watched it again instead of changing the channel and wondering in disbelief what the hell kris kross was doing on mtv . \na different mystery , i guess , which may turn into a _murder_ mystery if that video ever comes on again . . . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "when people are talking about good old times , they actually want to make some bad times look better . \nnice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s . \nfor new generations , superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion , cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids . \nfor people who actually had to live in that period , it was the gloomy decade , marked by lost ideals of 1968 , rampant inflation and unemployment , international terrorism , fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for . \nfeelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era . \nmartin scorsese's taxi driver , which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies , is most celebrated of them all . \nthe movie's protagonist is travis bickle ( robert de niro ) , 26-year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can't sleep at nights . \nthe job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis , and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world . \nthe only bright spot in his life is betsy ( cybil sheperd ) , attractive woman working in senator palantine's presidential campaign . \ntheir date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre . \nlosing his only link to better side of the world , travis gradually descends into psychosis , becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street . \nhe purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict . \nthat conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris ( jodie foster ) , 12-year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi . \nas many great movies that got cult status through the years , taxi driver became the object of many interpretations . \nfor some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski - loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty , overpopulated industrial cities ; the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times . \nfor others , the movie uses raskolnikov-like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade . \nbrilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides . \nhis travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation , loneliness and outrage towards crime , drugs , prostitution and senseless street violence . \nhis pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him , sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents , pimps or job interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero , and too pathetic to be the classic villain . \nhowever , most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen . \nbut despite anything , average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis - his crusade against \" scum \" is something that average person wants , but doesn't have a stomach/lack of brains to do it . \nwhile de niro's travis might come in and out of particular times and places , other persons that appear in the film ( mostly played by the character actors ) give it distinctively 1970s feel . \nwizzard ( played by peter boyle ) presents the only link with america's better past ; but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he \" knows stuff \" . \nhis obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade . \nother characters , on the other hand , show the bad side of new age . \nmatthew \" sport \" ( keitel , who befriended real-life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime ) is dressed like a hippie ; iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture . \nporno movies , that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom , are too much even for supposedly \" liberated \" betsy . \neven the politicians , like senator palantine , are lost in post-vietnam and post-watergate mess ; his broad and senseless \" messages \" that cover the lack of any serious program can't fool even such idiots like travis . \nthe past is gone , the present is bad , and even the future seems bleak , and the feeling of pessimism can't be washed away even by ironic happy end . \ntravis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation , and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader's screenplay into the silver screen . \nnew york city in the night is portrayed as a hell on earth , and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal , almost stygian atmosphere . \nanother important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman , whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture . \none of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was , same as his protagonist , famous for the wrong reason . \ninstead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits , for many years it was tabloid-fodder because of hinckley and his real-life re-enactment of events in the movie . \nnow , more than two decades later , when some other \" life imitating art \" incidents get more attention , we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "cinematically speaking , gordon parks' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film . \na bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman's \" black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks \" to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking . \nyet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned , \" blaxploitation , \" died with that decade--the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness . \nthe reason for this is the same one that explains the film's connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft . \nwhile the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass . \nthis fact also explains why john singleton's y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is . \nmuch like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_'s plot doesn't score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers . \ncontrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel/spinoff . \nthe star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972's _shaft's_big_score ! _ and 1973's _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city . \nhowever , the focus of the film lies on his same-named nephew ( samuel l . jackson ) , who , as the film begins , is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors . \nwhen a privileged young man named walter wade jr . ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal , racially-motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail , a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p . i . \nbut that's easier said than done , for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri ( toni collette ) , the only eyewitness to his crime . \npeoples--or , rather , wright is also the big obstacle in jackson's way toward commanding this film . \npeoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time , and wright is insanely funny during these stages . \nhowever , he isn't so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish , and peoples' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable ( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo , who bowed out before filming ) . \nit's no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating , charismatic self here ) , but that's exactly what wright does--and makes it seem effortless . \nthen again , with such a talented ensemble surrounding him , it is not too surprising that jackson's impressive star turn doesn't quite tower over the rest ; he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co-stars . \nbale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ , so it only follows that his performance as a similar , less exaggerated character would be spot-on . \ncollette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened , conflicted diane . \nbusta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft's sidekick rasaan . \nregistering not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno . \n ( jackson also has little to \" do \" in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside , his shaft doesn't even have one sex scene . ) \nthat singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he's not really an action director . \nthis is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases . \nthey move well ( as does the film as a whole ) and are reasonably exciting ; it's just that there's nothing terribly inventive about them . \nthese set pieces are functional in the way the script is : they work well enough , but they're unsurprising and conventional . \nbut if there's anything that a _shaft_ movie does well , it's make the familiar look cool--and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive . \nfrom the slick title sequence--scored , of course , to isaac hayes' ever-infectious oscar-winning theme song , which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film--on , the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado . \neven a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced , it feels necessary . \nstyle doesn't exactly make for a great film , but when it comes to _shaft_ , that's of little consequence . \nwhat matters above all else is having a good time , and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha--shut your mouth . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "it is an understood passion and an understood calm . \nbud white walks into the home of lynn bracken , a prostitute \" cut to look like veronica lake . \" \nhe's one of l . a .

different about an errol morris documentary -- besides the always-striking visuals -- is the interview style , where subjects seem to look directly at the viewer . \nweary of pressing his cheek

\nwith able assists from editors karen schmeer and shondra merrill and cinematographer robert richardson ( oliver stone's longtime collaborator ) , this becomes a cinematic contraption that's a wonder

you just can't get over lili taylor . \nis it possible to remain unperturbed that a woman of this age is playing a high school student ? \nharder still , can you avoid astonishment at how perfect she is in the part ? \nwith the sure , showy expertise of a de niro , taylor imbues unwed mother patti with all the faux fuck-you confidence she can muster . \nit's a deeply felt , dead-on performance , and by the halfway point you've forgiven taylor her own maturity . \nfor all its verite pretenses , girls town is less about a bunch of high-schoolers than it is about a movie director and a cadre of writer-performers examining their own feelings about rape , relationships , and american womanhood . \nthe movie's opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between a group of four smart/sassy high school outsiders on the verge of graduation : patti , angela ( bruklin harris ) , emma ( anna grace ) , and nikki ( aunjanue ellis ) . \nbut about 10 minutes into the film , we get word that nikki has swallowed a fistful of pills and bowed out of life . \nthe remaining girls manage to smug nikki's diary out of her grieving mother's home , and page through it at patti's place , investigating the root of nikki's despair . \nwhat they find is cruel and galvanizing -- nikki had been raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned , and was privately questioning the sanity and value of a world where such a thing could happen . \nshell-shocked by the truth of the matter , the three girls begin to talk among themselves and come to a realization about their own lives . \nemma says she was raped last year on a date with a football player . \npatti's barely sympathetic , wondering what the hell emma thought she was doing with her shirt off in a jock's car . \nand anyway , patti's had her own share of guys who wouldn't take no for an answer . \npained , acrimonious debate ensues as the trio grow more and more angry -- angry about the impossibility of saying no , and angry with themselves for being weak , for being naive , for putting up with it . \n \" why do we put up with it ? \" \nemma finally asks , once the argument has reached a fever pitch . \n \" we try to talk about it , and look what happens . \nwe fight for 20 minutes . \" \nthere's the admirable crux of this picture . \ngirls town is a political film , in that it calls for action . \nbut it's incomplete-it's never quite sure how to justify that action , or what form it should take . \nthe trio become crusaders for their right to dignity , and it's surely one of this year's most stirring movie moments when emma lobs a concrete block through the passenger-side window of that damn jock's car ( doing the right thing ? ) . \nthey hang out in the bathroom , chatting incessantly and scrawling slogans and naming names on the door to a toilet stall . \n \" subvert the patriarchy , \" emma writes , and then starts a hall of shame list underneath that other students begin to contribute to . \nthe girls silence their hecklers , take revenge on the deadbeat father of patti's child , and eventually come face-to-face with nikki's tormentor . \nstill , the movie has a desperately unfinished quality , and none of these subsequent exploits is particularly satisfying . \n ( you keep waiting for someone to call the cops on these brazen girls , but nobody thinks of it . ) \nperhaps searching for a resolution missing from the material at hand , the film borrows its epigraphs from audre lorde and queen latifah ( \" who you callin' a bitch ? \" ) . \nthe points are well taken , but they should have been unnecessary . \nlong on characterization but a little short on story , girls town is less than it could have been , and too self-congratulatory for my own taste .

mckay and his lead performers had to shoot on a shoestring when , predictably , the group couldn't secure funding . \nthen again , girls town on a budget would hardly be the same film . \nthe movie's slapdash quality is key to its significance . \ntruth be told , all three of the leads look too wise for high school , but that's ok -- there's a once-removed quality to their fine , spontaneous performances , as the women take a very skillful look back at the girls they once were , the girls they wish they had been , or some combination . \nfor all its flaws , this one gets extra points for having its uncertain head and heart in the same noble place . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory . \nthis

surprised at mel gibson's performance . \nhe provided a fantastic performance . \nthe previews of this film led me to believe it was an all-out action flick , which after viewing , it was almost the opposite in a certain sense . \ngibson's character has an almost uncountable number of one-liners , hilarious situations , and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film . \nfor instance , jerry's apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable . \nand last , i was surprised at how good the plot is . \nwriter brian helgeland has created a terrific story , and when watching this film , you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher's far-fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgeland's own opinions . \nmel gibson isn't the only stand-out in the film . \njulia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton , the department of justice employee who can't seem to stay away from jerry fletcher , who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories . \nhe also seems obsessed and in love with her . \nbut whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories , she shrugs him and his beliefs off , continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him . \njerry , obviously determined to continually seek out the truth , continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory , which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie ) . \nalthough he only has five subscribers , he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work , and publishes his next edition . \nvery soon after he does so , he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr . jonas ( patrick stewart ) . \nafter barely escaping alive , jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton . \nthe remainder of the film is almost always fast-paced and full of action and suspense , with jerry's life being constantly put into jeopardy . \nand more along the way , the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerry's life . \nmany things are explained throughout this film , both to the characters and to the audience . \nfor instance , the meaning of the book \" the catcher in the rye \" and its ties to assassins , the reason lone gunmen have three names ( e . g . \nlee harvey oswald and james earl ray ) , and the real truth behind the grateful dead . \nmake sure listen closely throughout the film , as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above . \ndefinitely , when

better than conspiracy theory , but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon . \nin other words , it's a decent couple of hours of entertainment , but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson's greatest hits , payback probably won't be on it . \ngibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll . \nmel's partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt . \nso he puts a couple of bullets in mel , leaving him for dead , and goes on to pay off his creditors . \nbut , mel isn't dead ( it would be a real short movie if he was ) and he certainly isn't happy . \nto make matters worse , he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat . \nhis ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters , so mel goes after the mob to get it back . \npayback is often a very violent film . \nto its credit , there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic , but the director ( i'm not sure which one -- more about that in a second ) made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films . \nthe film appears a bit disjointed in places , which is understandable considering producer / star gibson wasn't thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it re-shot . \nwhen the director refused , another one was brought in to do the re-shoot . \nso as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original ( although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake ) it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end . \nit's always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain , unless that person has some redeeming qualities . \nin this case , gibson's character has few redeeming qualities . \nbut hey , its mel , so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him . \nmy guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role , the audience would not be quite as responsive . \ngibson is gibson , whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer , he does a good job . \nhe almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance . \nthis time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast ,

a very good movie that does not as is so often the case fall out-of-balance in terms of too much pandering to the technological \" geek \" side . \nby the end , the audience is left with what good science fiction is supposed to do : evoke a sense of wonder about the universe and evoke questions in your mind about what's out there . \nthis movie does not let technology overshadow characterization and in this sense it is unusual amongst high-tech movies . \nhowever , except for jodie foster ( elie arroway ) and john hurt ( s . r . \nhadden ) , who are both actors of exceptional caliber , the supporting cast are not especially impressive . \nhurt certainly has had better roles ( stephen ward in scandal ) . \nthis one , as the multi-billionare hadden , does not do his acting skills justice . \nthis is clearly a foster movie by one of the great hollywood lights of our generation . \nfoster's radiance has never been more strong than in the scene where she finally meets the vegans on their terms . \nearly scenes take a long , long time to build up to this . \nthe movie's pacing is very good and subtle . \nthe panoramas of the radio dishes at arecibo and ceti in new mexico and puerto rico are beautiful . \nthe politics of foster's character attempting to obtain funding for research at these places are trite and predictable however . \none of the most entertaining , but very short scenes , is when foster is confronted by rob lowe , during a cabinet-level presidential meeting to discuss the alien invitation . \nthere were real sparks in this scene between foster and lowe and it would behoove them to consider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored . \nit is the only scene in the movie in which there were tremendous dynamics between two characters . \neverything else was very one-sided ( e . g . \nfoster ) . \nlowe can stand up to foster and it showed in that scene at the cabinet table . \nthe core scene of the movie is set on a surrealistic beach on a far-away world in the starsystem of vega . \nit feels a lot like science fiction writer john varley's scenes in his book steel beach , where the female protagonists encounters an immensely superior intelligence , in one case a computer manufactured by mankind itself , and in foster's case , an illusion drawn from her memory . \nin another sense , this immensely moving scene evokes gene roddenberry's star trek pilot the cage , later the menagerie , when jeffrey hunter and susan oliver have their memories manipulated to create new worlds in which they live and encounter aliens . \nthe concept is not new , by any sense , in the world of science fiction . \nbut the beach scene , which is the centerpiece of the film , as is the whole film , is driven by foster . \nfreed from her needs to direct by director zemecki , foster is able to let it all hang out in the characterization and the lead she provides to her supporting cast . \nas the movie gains speed , foster's acting intensifies and the audience really does experience it with her . \nit is certainly oscar-caliber acting , unquestionably . \nthe supporting cast does well and zemeckis throws in some humor with some president clinton cameos , cleverly manipulated , george stephanopolus-style , to seem very forrest gump . \nin fact , zemeckis et . \nal . \ngot in trouble for the usage of some of the footage seen in the movie , vis a vis clinton . \nbut the audience i attended this movie with just had some good chuckles at clinton's walk-ons . \nthe much-discussed tension between science and religion in this movie is not particularly insightful to those who have already gone through this course though it is helpful to those in the audience who have not . \nalso , the near-final scene , in a senate judiciary hearing room is disappointing . \ncontact is a fitting memorial to the memory of carl sagan , science popularizer , and sometime pedantic gadfly of the halls of academe . \nperhaps now , sagan can be said to be with his dragons of eden . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "anyone who saw alan rickman's finely-realized performances in truly madly deeply and sense and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actor-turned-director is a bit of a poet at heart . \nhowever , for those who recall him only as the maniacal villain of die hard and robin hood : prince of thieves , this recognition may be something of a shock . \nnevertheless , \" poetic \" is an excellent term to describe rickman's feature debut as a director , the winter guest . \nthe film has a simple , unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements to fashion a successful whole . \nthe result is an occasionally haunting , sometimes magical , and always insightful human drama . \nthe winter guest isn't about resolving plot threads and advancing a story line ; it's about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages . \nthe winter guest does not tell a traditional tale , nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure ? there is no real beginning or end . \ninstead , we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eight humans . \nthey represent both sexes , multiple generations , and a variety of relationships ? male and female ; young , middle-aged , and elderly ; friends , would-be lovers , and kin . \nwe see expectations fulfilled and disappointed , emotional boundaries eroded , and truths unveiled . \nthere is comedy and tragedy . \nmost importantly , much of what transpires during the course of the winter guest will find an echo in our own lives ? in this fiction can be found much truth . \nthe setting is small town in scotland on the coldest day of the year . \nit's so frigid that the sea has begun to freeze over . \nthe onshore wind cuts like a knife and snow blankets the beach , giving the terrain an alien appearance . \nit is against this backdrop that the relationships of the film are captured . \nthere are four pairings , and , although there is some interaction between the different twosomes , the winter guest's focus is on the dynamics internal to each relationship . \nthe first , meatiest pairing is that of elspeth ( phylida law ) and her recently-widowed daughter , frances ( emma thompson ) . \nthese two have a stormy relationship . \nthey love each other deeply , but both are stubborn and willful , and neither is willing to admit that they need the other . \nmuch of their interaction is argumentative , but , during the course of a long walk to the frozen shoreline , they come to an unspoken understanding of how much each means to the other . \nfrances' adult son , alex ( gary hollywood ) , is a lonely young man who has been caring for his mother since the death of his father . \non this day , he meets a girl , nita ( arlene cockburn ) , who has secretly been spying on him for weeks . \nalthough their first encounter is antagonistic ( she throws a snowball at him ) , both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction . \nonce they retire to a place where they can be alone , however , things don't go exactly as planned . \nlily ( sheila reid ) and chloe ( sandra voe ) are a couple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees . \ndeath is a topic of endless fascination for them , perhaps because they are so close to it , and they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries , looking for the next funeral or cremation in the area . \nit doesn't matter whether or not they knew the deceased . \nit's the ceremony that they're interested in . \nsam ( douglas murphy ) and tom ( sean biggerstaff ) , a pair of schoolboy chums , are spending this cold february day cutting classes and hanging out at the beach , horsing around , building a small fire for warmth , and walking on the frozen water . \nunlike lily and chloe , these two have their entire lives ahead of them . \nthey are young enough to still believe in magic , but old enough to recognize that the process of crossing into adulthood robs life of the simple joy that only children can experience . \nthe acting is strong and believable . \nthe mixture of veteran performers and first-timers is effective , with the most successful choice being the casting of real-life mother and daughter phylida law and emma thompson in the most prominent roles . \nthere is a chemistry in their interaction that would be hard to replicate with two different , non-related actors . \nand , of course , the physical resemblance makes it that much easier to accept elspeth and frances as parent and child . \nthe winter guest began its life as a stage play in 1995 , with rickman as the director . \nfour of the film's principals , phylida law , arlene cockburn , sheila reid , and sandra voe , appeared in the theatrical version before moving to the film . \nunlike several recent motion pictures adapted from plays , the winter guest has been successfully opened up . \nthe rough , bleak scottish countryside becomes as much of a character as any of the eight humans . \nin fact , considering how important the climate is to every relationship under rickman's microscope , it could be argued that this is the single most important element of the movie . \nif you appreciate character studies , the winter guest is a solid effort with enough power to stay with you after you have left the theater .

main characters are downright lousy in bed . \nsex is in the film because ( sexual ) deviance is part of the film's major theme of \" difference \" breeding hostility . \nin my opinion this kind of movie sex is cutting edge for 1999 , as rare and thought-provoking in american cinema as showing a spanking . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "contact is the 1997 movie i've seen the most - five times to be exact . \nfour of those times were on the big screen , but even on a tv , it's a very impressive film . \nthe same can't be said for films like independance day , but that's because contact is a rare example in sci-fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects , and all of us know looking back that id4 didn't offer much outside of some one-time delightful eye candy . \ncontact's wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) , a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of \" merely listening \" to sounds out in space . \nher interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age , encouraged by her loving father , ted ( david morse ) , who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola , fl ( that was , of course , before the days of internet chat rooms ) . \nwhile everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ( of which the program seti is an acronym for ) , ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on , keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive . \nellie's strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist , a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young . \nin puerto rico , she meets palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a writer examining the effects of technology on the world's overall happiness ; a one- time seminary student who describes himself as \" a man of the cloth , without the cloth \" . \ndespite the vast differences in opinion regarding a \" supreme being \" , ellie and palmer hit it off , and even take the time to sleep together . \nit's a weak and hurried relationship , but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on . \nmeanwhile , dr . david drumlin ( tom skerritt ) , who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money , is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding . \nthis leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors , eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation , and only a one night stand to remember . \nit is in this nm city where , several months later , ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space , perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science . \nwhen the signal is closely examined , many new developments spring up , and before long , drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at . \neventually , it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega ( where the signal seems to have originated ) . \nthe media swarms , fanatics go further off the deep end , scientists clamor for new information , politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take , and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality ( remember when zemeckis couldn't get enough of this in forrest gump ? ) . \nas if that weren't enough , ellie's discovery leads her to the nation's capital where she again runs into palmer . \ncontact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs . religion . \nthe impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented , with no signs of bias . \narguments for both sides are intelligent , solid , and thought-provoking . \nwhen palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega ( of which ellie is a leading candidate ) , personal convictions play a more important role than love interests . \nthe question is , can a person who doesn't believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90% of the planet * does * believe in a higher power ? \neven when the film wraps up , it's uncertain whether it's meant to play as an advocate for religion , science , both , or even neither , and in our modern day society where \" right and wrong \" is only opinion ( at least speaking \" politically correctly \" ) , the ambiguity is an incentive . \ndon't get me wrong . \nas much as it sounds like it , contact isn't merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film . \nit's a * highly * enjoyable two and a half hours . \ndespite its seemingly heavy issues , it's not a tedious undertaking to watch this film . \nthe special effects are outstanding , though ( warning ! ) \nhighly depreciated on the small screen . \neven so , some of the subtle visual effects ( that will likely go unnoticed by many ) are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as \" sci-fi \" . \nthe storytelling is rich and complete , and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious ( and at times , even hokey ) , it's easily one of the best 1997 films , and one of the best sci-fi films i've ever seen . \nthis is zemeckis' best since back to the future , and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated , zemeckis now has real reason to boast . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "bruce barth's mellow piano plays in

hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr . cage . \nthe perpetually awful assassination thriller `snake eyes' was one of 1998's worst films . \n`8mm' was a disappointing lost cause . \nbut who better than scorsese to match cage's wit and intensity , which he does in miraculous fashion with `bringing out the dead' . \ncage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce , a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from day-to-day . \nafter five years of the stress-inducing job , frank basically just staggers onward , relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze

unique how scorsese used each of these characters for a single shift with frank , but they never figured into the actual plot . \neach is merely a colorful presence to help develop frank's character , because `bringing out the dead' is predominantly a study of his mind and detailed personality . \nthe one character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary ( patricia arquette ) , the daughter of a newly admitted patient who suffered from a severe heart attack . \narquette , who recently received the wounds of christ in `stigmata' , performs well around real-life husband cage . \nit's unfortunate that , after such intriguing character trials and tribulations , the relationship between frank and mary slips during a mishandled , ineffective finale . \nthe movie belongs to the one-two punch of cage and scorsese , who were born to collaborate their efforts in an arrangement similar to `bringing out the dead' . \nalthough it certainly lacks the grit and hard-edge of something like `goodfellas' , scorsese manages to hit a nerve with his latest picture . \nthe incredible camera-work and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration . \nfans will be pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive , darkly humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with 1997's `kundun' . \ndoes `bringing out the dead'

mesmerizing , haunting , adult psychodrama about marriage , fidelity and sex . \nit's a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end , consistently exhibiting the auteur's trademark penchant for long , continuous takes , his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast ( indeed , eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot : kubrick , a renowned perfectionist , reportedly held his cast \" hostage \" on the set for nearly a year ) . \nin an uncharacteristic maneuver , kubrick cast two big-name stars in the lead roles , namely real-life husband and wife tom cruise and nicole kidman . \nthey play bill and alice harford , a volatile couple who , during the course of a couple nights , ponder the validity of the idea that a husband and a wife must be faithful to each other . \nhe is an m . d . , she's unemployed and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go to a fancy party . \nat the affair , they are both propositioned and both nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else . \nwhen they return to their lavish new york apartment kidman ( after smoking a dash of weed ) inquires whether her husband had sex with two models who approached him during the night . \nhe ( truthfully ) says that he did not and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing with . \nthey proceed to argue until alice tells her spouse a lustful story : evidently some time ago , she had a thing for a young naval officer . \nshe admits that she was ready to give up her whole future with bill and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night . \nbill is jolted by alice's story and we anticipate his reaction , but at that moment he gets a phone call and has to go \" show his face \" at the house of a just-deceased patient . \nthis turns out to be the beginning of a long and eventful night on the town . \nthe daughter of the dead patient hits on him but he wisely turns her down . \nhe almost does the dirty deed with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street . \nthen , through a series of coincidences , he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic ( and frankly , creepy ) orgy takes place , with costumed people performing various public sex acts on each other . \nerotic dread mounts as cruise ( who's not supposed to be there ) wonders the spacious halls watching the \" action \" until he is discovered to be an outsider . \nmuch hoopla has been raised over the fact that warner bros . digitally edited the orgy scene . \nwith the help of a computer , they put in cloaked figures to block some of the actual sex acts ( they can still be seen , just not in all their glory ) in order to avoid the dreaded nc-17 rating . \neuropean viewers will see the film as kubrick envisioned it . \nroger ebert calls the american version the \" austin powers version , \" and many others have bashed the alterations . \ni am of the potentially controversial opinion that the figures only supplement the scene's mystical atmosphere . \nthe first thing one notices about eyes wide shut is how it looks . \nthis is an artful , distinctively gorgeous production , shot in dark , moody hues and featuring some elaborate , beautiful scenery . \nfrom the giant mansion used in the film's centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party to the harford's apartment , this film is always a pleasure to look at . \nto boot , a great soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still . \nat the core , behind the graphic , controversial content and unappealing mood , this is a good-natured movie that emphasizes the importance of fidelity . \nit looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic . \nit's something superficial and yet something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship . \nat the end , it seems , bill's eyes are wide open to the special kind of love he and his wife have for each other , more meaningful than anything he could ever hope to find on the streets of new york . \nkubrick elicits wonderful performances from both cruise and kidman . \ntom is completely convincing as dr . harford , a man who seems guided solely by destiny , with no control of the course his life will take . \nnicole projects a quiet intensity as the jittery yet aggressive wife and her performance is stunningly effective : she's headed for an oscar nod . \nthe movie has some help from a similarly strong supporting cast , at the head of which is director-cum-thespian sidney pollock , enigmatic and articulate as harford's mysterious friend . \neyes wide shut is not perfect : the last hour could have used a slightly more scissor-happy editor and both cruise and kidman are too good- looking for me to believe that either would have a very strong temptation to philander . \nstill , this is an important work from a great director , and

{"content": "kadosh means sacred in hebrew . \namos gitai's fictional work , after spending most of his career doing documentaries , is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage , even though the marriage is a loving one . \nthe marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli's modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic's intolerable one , as both groups are vying for control of the secular government . \ngitai ( devarim/yom yom ) is a labor party leftist , who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government , it would sound the death knell of israel . \nthe emphasis of the film is on how the ultra-orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god's law from only the male's view . \nthat if they ever got control of the country , their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are . \nthe story takes place in jerusalem's jewish quarters called mea shearim , where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls , and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life , which is much different than the way most jews live in israel . \nthis is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief . \nit is a slow-moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go . \nthe force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance . \nthe film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people , as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes , it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they can't at present live in harmony with their own people , and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace . \nthe film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual , where every prayer is made to the virtues of god . \nhe even thanks god that he didn't make him a woman . \nhis wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom . \nshe looks at him with glistening eyes , not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life , and from seeing movies and tv . \nmeir is a talmudic scholar . \nhis father ( abu warda ) is a rabbi at the yeshiva . \nhe has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child . \nsince the hasidim look upon a woman's role in life being only to conceive children , and cook and clean house for the man , while the man's role is to spend his time in prayer , therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage . \nshe receives an anonymous letter that states \" a woman without a child is no better than dead . \" \nmeir's response , is that it is written like that in the talmud . \nmeir's father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken : \" a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah . \" \nall the blame is placed on rivka , who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren . \nshe will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself , as her rigid mother ( koenig ) dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel . \ntheir religion doesn't permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor . \nrivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile , but she cannot tell him that because of their religion . \nso when meir's father chooses a younger woman for his son , she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters . \nrivka's spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life . \nshe has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov . \nbut , because of the way they were both raised , she is still a virgin . \nwhen yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon , something his sect is not allowed to do , he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still a believer . \nhe now works as a singer in a nightclub . \nmalka's mother is worried that her daughter won't get married , so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef , someone whom she doesn't love . \nyossef is a very stern follower of the order , he is also a political activist who drives around the city in a sound-truck with a bull-horn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies . \nthe two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options , with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage , it will make her happy ; but , while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it , she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage . \nthe harshest scene in the film is on malka's wedding night . \nyossef prays to god for a child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs , and without the least bit of affection , only a nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies , as he goes inside her and rams her hard , thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without a word or gesture of love . \nthe sisters have choices , like everyone else in life does . \nbut the choices are obliterated by one's beliefs , circumstances , and inward nature , and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up . \nfor the sisters , the choices are life or death ones . \ngitai by closing in on the daily rituals , tight living quarters and close-knit community , has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life . \nthe film ends with the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking down upon it as an outsider would , and everything seems strange to her , all the things she once thought of as being set in stone are now harsh memories , as she has made her choice , and the price of that choice is very heavy indeed . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "mars attacks ! \n ( 1996 ) - c : jack nicholson , glenn close , annette bening , martin short , danny devito , rod steiger

figured that one out . \nthis almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg's latest \" serious \" film . \nduring the late 1830s , a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa's west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery . \nfifty-three of them are stuffed into the \" la amistad \" ( from a spanish

property . \nif they are property , who do they belong to ? \ntheir masters ? \nthe spanish government ? \nsalvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ? \nthe us government ? \nthe defendants are pawns in several games . \nabolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them , but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause . \ntheir lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees . \nsouth carolina senator john c . calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states . \npresident martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends

urging of calhoun , the president then appeals the case to the supreme court , populated by a majority of slave-owners . \nthis little-known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america's past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court . \nthe slavery issue is easy pickin's for spielberg . \nmuch like his \" shindler's list \" ( which followed \" jurassic park \" as this follows \" lost world \" ) , the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose . \nnazis and slave traders : both treat groups of others as less than human . \nit's not hard to see who the bad guys are . \nwithout that question to ponder , the director's job is more difficult . \nhe has to make the story interesting . \nspielberg succeeds for the most part . \nthe visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach . \nwhere the movie falls down is a bit more subtle . \nthere are very few _people_ in the tale . \nin fact , cinque is the only character who is fleshed out . \ntappan and joadson are \" abolitionists \" : symbols but not humans . \nvan buren is a weak politician but nothing else . \nthe rest of the \" slaves \" barely exist other than dressing for the set . \nlike many other films about people of color , almost all the major players are white . \nthe film's salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou . \nthe former model's first major role is a winner . \nwithout speaking more than five words of english , he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog . \nthe other stand-out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents ( he also played the

. \nthe central premise behind the film is an inspired and promising one . \nbobby bowfinger ( martin ) , a cheapskate and small-time hollywood producer , has always dreamed of making a successful motion picture but has never attained the proper tools to do so . \na new script , an alien invasion story entitled chubby rain , has caught bowfinger's eye . \nafter confronting a big-name producer named jerry renfro ( robert downey jr . ) in a restaurant , an agreement is made to finance the movie . \nbut first , bowfinger must get renowned action star kit ramsey ( eddie murphy ) to sign in on the project . \nkit turns the offer down immediately , but bowfinger still has the intent to shoot the film . \nafter emptying out his life savings , the hapless producer tells the remaining cast and crew that ramsey is involved , and then prepares to film the movie without the star's knowledge . \nthe actors confront ramsey on the street , saying their lines as hidden cameras peek through bushes to capture the footage . \nthe unknowing star , who is terrified of aliens and being abducted , is brought to believe there is actually pod people after him . \nwhen the conditions become even more treacherous , bowfinger is forced to hire a kit ramsey look-alike named jiff ( also murphy ) , a sweet-natured dork who runs for coffee in-between shooting vital scenes . \nthese include attempting a suicide run across an 8-lane freeway , and one of the `hot' scenes involving supporting actress daisy ( heather graham ) removing her blouse . \nbowfinger takes it's sweet time getting started , but when the plot switches into high gear , great things happen . \ncertain scenes are so precisely executed , perfectly framing moments that are absolutely fall-down funny . \nno , hilarious . \nstandouts include the chase through a parking garage in which ramsey , who's supposed to be being followed , keeps checking behind him to investigate a strange tapping noise ( it's actually bowfinger's dog in high heels ) . \nand just try not to laugh in the climactic kung-fu sequence , featuring jiff in an excerpt from another bowfinger classic entitled fake purse ninjas . \nwhile the entire 97-minutes of bowfinger isn't always on target , individual scenes may have you rolling in the aisles . \nmasterful comedy director frank oz ( dirty rotten scoundrels , in and out ) , who has never made a bad movie , ensures a quality final product and is aided immensely by martin's sharp-edged script . \nhowever , the real on-screen star is eddie murphy . \nthis is the actor's finest work since his breakthrough into the hollywood market in the early 80's . \nmurphy excels at every corner , not only succeeding with presenting believable paranoia in the eyes of kit ramsey , but in creating a likable buffoon in jiff as well . \nthese three talented comic minds have squeezed every morsel of potential out of this premise , and the reward is a virtually guaranteed helping of hearty laughs . \nsteve martin generates the power behind bowfinger , but murphy fuels it . \nthis is a summer-time comedy that , unlike something such as american pie and south park , doesn't break any rules . \nbut it's still just as uproarious , or perhaps even more side-splitting than anything we've seen this season . \nthe supporting cast , including christine baranski as a work-loving actress and jamie kennedy as the cameraman , all perform well within their limits . \nthe only presence that demands real attention when placed next to martin or murphy is the beautiful heather graham , as the young film star who has plans to sleep her way to the top . \ngraham , attempting to further her stardom after appearing as the new powers' girl in ap2 , displays a cheerful but naive persona that

playing senator lillian dehaven is a ruthless , machiavellian politician with an agenda to push . \nusing feminism to achieve political mileage , she forces the military powers that be to backdown and permit a test case to enter the highly intensive navy s . e . a . l . \ntraining . \njordan is selected due to the fact that she has it all - looks , brains and strength . \nthe training is gruelling and the indignity almost painful to watch . \nnonetheless , it's one of those movies that makes me want to cheer out and encourage the hapless hero/heroine along in his/her endeavours . \nsure , there are the stereotypical elements - inhuman treatment , sexual innuendo , resentful peers , pained boyfriend and sexist commanding officer . \nstepping away from the stereotypes though , viggo mortensen as master chief john urgayle tries to get away from being nothing more than a brutal screamer . \nhis character exercises a little more intellectual rigour than you would normally expect from such a character . \njordan's boyfriend royce is also in the military . \nalthough they both started at the same time , due to the fact that he has seen active service , he has advanced through the ranks much more quickly than she has . \nroyce ( what is his surname ? \ndo we care ? ) \nalmost resents jordan's attempts to advance herself , although he quickly settles down to being doe-eyed and supportive . \nhis character seems to have been thrown in so that we know that you don't have to be a lesbian to want to be in the military . \nin parts , this is a very silly movie , with gratuitous lines and scenes thrown in for effect which are so blatantly obvious or contrived that it's hard not to cringe . \ni still liked it though . \nweaknesses in the script aside , this is a film which captures a heroic and reckless mood . \nas we watch jordan's battle , it's increasingly clear that it is a personal battle . \nthis is an individual's fight for self-advancement . \nwe don't have to have our teeth set on edge by didactic preachings , we don't have to feel uncomfortable because we're having ideology thrust down our throats . \nit's enough that we can sit back and hope that this

"robocop is an intelligent science fiction thriller and social satire , one with class and style . \nthe film , set in old detroit in the year 1991 , stars peter weller as murphy , a lieutenant on the

. \nto make matters worse , a savage group of cop-killers has been terrorizing the city . \non murphy's first day of duty , after his transfer from another precinct , these cop-killers brutally murder

hospital cannot save murphy and declare him clinically dead , s . c . i . \nrecruits his remains for their new \" robocop \" program . \nusing the remains of murphy's body as a foundation , their scientists build a cyborg , made of both flesh and metal . \nthe cyborg ( robocop ) is half human ( murphy ) and half robot ; the s . c . i . \nengineers have erased murphy's memory and replaced it with a computer program ( or so they think ) . \nwith his lightning quick reflexes , immense strength , and impenetrable armor , s . c . i . \nenvisions robocop as an indestructible super-cop : the solution to detroit's problems . \nthe remainder of the plot follows robocop's crime-foiling and vengeance on his murderers . \nas a science fiction action-thriller , robocop is extremely effective . \ndutch director paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense , shocking gore , and spectacular special effects . \nseveral sequences in the film , such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim to stop a rapist , are destined to become cult-classics . \nbecause robocop is so visually and emotionally rousing , it demands to be seen on a large screen with an audience--in other words , in a movie theater . \nalthough the special effects and action are exciting , they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre . \nrather , robocop stands out for its accurate and biting satire of american society . \nthe movie makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative , terrorism , board games , and television news broadcasts with air-headed anchors . \nthese news broadcasts , which are exceptionally clever , recur periodically throughout the movie and help to provide comic relief from the intense action and gore . \nthe satire in robocop , however , is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense and blood . \n1990's america , as portrayed in the film , may seem far fetched but is in actuality ( i think ) only a slight exaggeration of the current state of american society . \nthe humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible and absurd . \nverhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an entertaining and enlightening piece of science fiction/social commentary . \nunfortunately , robocop possesses several flaws which prevent it from qualifying as a classic within the genre . \nthe movie lacks the lasting impact of such films as the road warrior , the terminator , and aliens . \nrobocop's main problem , aside from its dumb title , is that it does not sufficiently develop murphy's character . \nwe never learn the degree to which murphy ( as robocop ) is human and the degree to which he is a robot . \ndoes murphy have any human spirit or free will left , or is he merely a computer following a program ? \nthe script halfheartedly raises these issues but then abandons them in its climactic flurry of gory action . \nmoreover , it almost completely ignores the question ( and tragedy ) of denying a man his right to die in favor of turning him into a machine . \nrobocop also contains several bothersome loose-ends . \nas you watch robocop , you experience deja vu ; you feel as if you have seen the film before . \nin many respects , robocop is reminiscent of several other films , including the terminator , return of the jedi , and even death wish . \nhowever , to its credit , robocop easily has enough originality and unique personality to avoid becoming a cheap rip-off . \n", "tag": 1}, {"content": "bob the happy bastard's quickie review : \nthe matrix \nwhat's

illiterate by some . \njudging by a series of poorly recieved ( financial and critical ) comic book based films ( such as batman and robin , steel , barb wire , the crow : city of angels , and the list goes on ) , one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film . \nto some degree , i agree with this sentiment . \nhaving read comic books since the age of nine ( i'm 21 right now ) i can count the number of good comic book based movies ( not including japanese manga ) one hand : 1 : the crow ( 1994 ) , 2 : batman ( 1989 ) , 3 : superman , 4 : the mask , and now , #5 , blade . \n ( \" men in black \" is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book ) \nwhy is this ? \nfor the most part , it is because the filmmakers understand \nthe comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match . \nthe crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere , which the director provided . \nthe mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics , which the casting and cg effects reflect . \nsuperman \nis not over the top with colour and flash , and the film reflects this . \nblade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film , creating an appropriate atmosphere . \nthis is in stark contrast to joel schumacher's contrived vision in batman and robin , reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960's television show . \nbatman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact : comics have grown up , and so has the audience ( i'm working on a scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when i'm ready ) . \nwhich brings me back to blade . \nalthough he may be a familiar character to some , due to his appearances in the spider-man animated show on fox , one will find no single trace of the warm-and-fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon . \nthe film depicts a vicious vampire killer that \nuses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends . \nthe end results are not pretty by any means . \nthe story elements work very well -- for a comic book story . \nscreenwriter david goyer ( who also wrote the crow ) incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore , using science to explain many of the ideas often dismissed in vampire films . \nthis is presented through karen , a hematologist portrayed by n'bushe wright . \nthis leads to inventive use of standard medical treatments to kill vampires . \nadd this \nto the neat little gadgets that blade uses ( including a titanium sword complete with an \" anti-theft device \" ) , and one has an interesting premise . \nhowever , the film works best as an action film . \nactor wesley snipes has \nan extensive background in martial arts ( most of which comes from capoeira , a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks ) , choreographing every single move . \nproving that quick , flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequences ( see batman and robin for a \ngood example of that ) , wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes . \nregardless , this film is far from perfect . \nthe film suffers from at least one major plot hole , regarding the summoning of the blood god . \nthe ritual requires that a number of pure blood vampires are standing on \nmarked squares , yet one of them is viciously murdered , allowing the ritual to pass ( and the murdered vampire is later shown standing on the square ) . \nobvious continuity errors also surface , especially during a scene where deacon frost takes a drag on his cigarette and is not exhaling it in the next frame ( there is no trace of smoke either ) . \nmuch of the special effects are not that spectacular either . \nwhile vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch , other cgi ( computer generated imagery ) effects are almost slapped together , which is surprising when given the amount of time the film was given to be released ( the film's release date was pushed back multiple times ) . \nscenes with computer generated blood look extremely fake , knocking the believability factor down a few notches ( but then , i'm really hard to impress ) . \nthe film's r rating comes from gory violence , but the lack of \nrealism made me wonder why it got such a rating ( for realistic violence , \nwatch \" saving private ryan \" ) . \nthe overuse of cgi in films has made me yearn for the days of director george romero and makeup wizard rob bottin , both pioneers in the art of gore without extensive use of cgi . \nstill , scenes involving non-cgi special effects do surface ( and look much more impressive ) , such as one particularly gruesome scene where a vampire tries to use blade's

kenneth branagh , director/actor/co-writer of mary shelley's frankenstein . \nkenneth branagh's new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein-films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world , including the most controversial version of them all - directed by james whale . \nthe dark and stormy nights , the lightning bolts , the charnel houses of spare body parts , the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful . \nbut the center of the film , quieter and more thoughtful , contains the real story . \nhorror-fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror . \nbranagh has instead concentrated on serious issues : morality , philosophy and human elements of the story , and not on old fashioned horror cliches . \nhis version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel . \nthe film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean . \nthe year is 1794 . \na bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters . \nhis gole is to reach the north pole at all costs . \nas the ice closes around his ship , a figure appears on the horizon . \nit's a man . \nexhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew . \nhis name is victor frankenstein ( kenneth branagh ) and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown . \nthe myserious stranger begins his tale , or more precisely his confession , in geneva , 1773 . \nhe is remembering his childhood and youth . \nlaughter , banquets and parties - a happy life , without troubles or concerns . \nhere victor lived with his father ( ian holm ) , mother ( cherie lunghi ) , his surrogate sister ( helena boham carter ) and his servants in happiness and harmony . \nthis idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed . \nlike thunder from a quite sky , his mother dies , giving birth to his youngest brother . \nshocked , baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair , victor ( already interested in science ) becomes obsessed with death . \nstanding on his mother's grave he says : \" oh mother . . you \ndid not have to die . . . no one should ever die . . . i \nwill stop this . . i \npromiss . . \" \nafter proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished , victor travels to ingolstadt , in presuite of a medical career . \nafter a while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night , creating life from death . \ncomposing dead bodies , frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man - both physically and mentally . \nwith strong electrical impulses , he managed to breeth life into his creation . \nthe result was ugliness . \nrealizing what he has done , frankenstein tried to undo his work , but it was to late . \nthe creature has escaped . \nbecause of the epidemic , frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned to his home , making plans for the wedding . \nfor a while everything is as it was before his mother's death . \nbut then one by one his loved once are dying mysteriously . . . \nwhale's picture , although powerful , never managed to capture the total depth of the novel . \nbrannagh has more or less done that . \nanother thing is characters and actors . \nbranagh has developed every character and assembled a magnificent cast . \nthe greatest performances comes from de niro - the monster , that has been played by ( among others ) charles ogle , karloff , lon chaney , bela lugosi , glenn strange , christopher lee , fred gwynne ( as herman munster ) , and now , robert de niro . \nalone , hated and feared , he is completely aware of his ugliness . \nat first he is like a helpless , abandoned child , desperately reaching out for love . \nlater when he reads frankenstein's journal , and learns that he is composed of dead bodies , his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge . \nhe is capable of killing without regret . \n \" i took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground . . . . and \nthen i slowly crushed his neck . . . and \nas i killed him , i saw your face . . \" \nthat is how he reveals his savage nature to his creator . \nand yet , he is never quite evil in our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable : \" for the sympathy of one living being i would make peace with all . \" \nrarely has a cinematic interpretation of \" the daemon \" approached the level of three-dimensionality and humanity with which it is portrayed in the novel . \nanother vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein . \nin most of the previous adaptions he was simply a mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates a monster ( god knows why ! ) with the power of an electrical storm . \nalmost no time was granted on his charecter , who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel . \nhere , branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein , establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death , sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment , and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene . \nbranagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character . \non the outside he is strong , ambitious and talented scientist , but deep down he is unsecure , fragile and vaulerble , constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past . \nhelen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankenstein's surrogate sister , who at the end becomes his wife for a little while , before death drives them apart . \nthe rest of the cast , playing secondary characters , is solid and nothing less than convincing . \nvisually the film is stunning ( especially the makeup ) . \nthe spinning camera , the constantly building-up musical acore , the art direction , the production design , the costumes are all magnificent : from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests , to the plague-riddled streets of ingolstadt , mary shelley's frankenstein is a wonder to behold . \nkenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare : \" . . all \ni once loved lies in a shallow grave . . . . by \nmy hand . . \" . \nand the film ends exacly as hamlet , when the creature sets both his and his creator's body on fire . \nthe film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness . \nand a terrifying last close-up on the creature's smiling face . \ncan a man create life , then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him ? \nto whom are its actions then attributable : the creature or the being who brought about its existence ? \nshelley did not answer these questions , but she certainly posed them . \nfollowing her example , branagh does the same . \nhis film is a tragic saga about playing god . \nvictor frankenstein is not an evil man . \nhe wanted to change the world to the better . \nin this he represents everything science stands for : acting without doubts , never considering the consequences of his actions . \nproduced by francis ford coppola , frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film \" dracula \" . \nin comparison , i can say that \" dracula \" has visuals that even \" frankenstein \" can not live up to . \nbut when it comes to story , characters and casting , \" frankenstein \" is stronger . \nbut stronger than both of them , on every aspect , is neil jordan's \" interview with the vampire \" . \nalthough the film is not perfect ( the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective ) , these minor faults are easily forgivable , as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating . \nbranagh has probably created one of the best ( if not the best ) adaptions of shelly's classic novel .

, burbank's life is being broadcast live to the american public , and seahaven and all it's inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage . \nthe film takes the jerry springer format one step too far . . . \nwith an idea so different , it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator . \nluckily , the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages , yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie . \ntalking of carrey , he's perfect in this movie , enjoying the best role in his career . \nhis character is a re-inforced stanley

only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie . \nthat is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger ebert , who also was responsible for the screenplay . \nafter watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face . \nthis movie stinks out loud . \nquite

knew that i had a class-a bomb on my hands . \nnot only are the way the credits actually shot distracting , but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform . \ni had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene . \nto be honest , as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film . \nwith the quality of the writing during the rest of the film , it wouldn't have surprised me if the opening had never been explained . \nso what is this movie about ? \nyou ask . \nlike it really matters . \nok , here goes . \nthis all-girl band headed by kelly macnamara ( dolly reed ) and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry . \nonce there , they do manage to find success ( due as much to their hooters as anything else ? it sure wasn't for their brutally bad singing voices ) , and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them . \neverything from big egos , to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral . \nthere are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure , but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing . \n>from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here . \nother than the above-mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have . \nthe dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts . \nmr . ebert has generously thrown in helpings of \" hey man \" , \" dig \" and my all time favorite -- \" this is my happening , and it freaks me out \" . \nnow i ask you , with lines like that how can you go wrong ? \nebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue . \nmaybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter . \ni don't know , but all the big words in the world wouldn't be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting . \nbut the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie . \ni've seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey . \nin fact , there is one scene -- the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes -- during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries . \nadd to the directing and writing the music in this movie . \ni almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken , there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers . \nthen we have the cast . \nfirst lets start david gurian who played harris , the manager of the band . \nthis has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera . \nsadly , his acting doesn't come close to making up for his looks . \nif you have been following along up to this point , this shouldn't surprise you . \nmeyer's stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets . \ndolly reed plays kelly , the leader of the band . \nand no surprise here , she was cast for her cup size , not her talents . \nand yes , she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents . \nsadly , her ass is almost as large as her chest . \nhey , it a sexist movie , so i'm writing a sexist review . \nthen we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey , one of the other band members . \nthis goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie . \nmeyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all , but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all . \nsure russ , now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows . \non the up side , she does have a fun lesbo scene . \ni sound like i'm writing a review in a porn magazine . \nbut hey , i'll admit it ; the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked . \nand since that was a huge disappointment , i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey . \nthe only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it . \nunless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too . \nand if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d's -- you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers

incredible palate of female talent , and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as `sleepless in seattle' and `unsung heroes' . \nmeg ryan , diane keaton and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who , once separated by career judgments over family ties , must reunite when their father ( walter matthau ) is admitted into the hospital with alzheimer's disease . \nwhile this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past , the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating , shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery . \n`hanging up' has the overall effect of a tele-marketer pestering you for two hours , while you don't have the option of doing as the title suggests . \nfor the first half-hour , the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development . \nthis is an annoying and ineffective device . \ncell-phones ring every five minutes , and everyone hurriedly rushes along , leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters' issues and problems . \nif `hanging up' was an apple pie , then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story . \ngranted , there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film . \nbut they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck . \nthe most outrageous strategy in `hanging up' is that , after a series of largely unrealized attempts at character development , we are expected to exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale . \nwe are able to identify with eve ( ryan ) , the most open and caring daughter , because she is the one who stayed by her father's side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career . \ngeorgia ( keaton ) , the eldest daughter , is celebrating the fifth year anniversary of her magazine called . . . . \n`georgia' . \nmaddy (

co-star and director - a time slot that can be a difficult priority juggle . \nher frenzy is apparent . \nfor a chick flick , there is a distressing lack of chuckles . \nthe reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that , given his character's situation , seems more depressing than amusing . \neven so , the peak form of humor in `hanging up' is represented by some of matthau's nasty quips and ryan's eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a pill . \nthat about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film . \nmy curiosity has suddenly been

old lady who lives out on the lake . \nyou know what to expect from this movie : lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator ( croc cam ) swimming toward someone's dangling legs while \" jaws \" -like music plays , one character ( hector ) who's obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest , another character who insists that the predator can't possibly exist . \nunlike its slippery cousin \" anaconda , \" \" lake placid \" wants to present its formulaic plot tongue-in-cheek , which is self-defeating . \nthe result is neither scary nor funny ; it's just tedious .

just because i'm male . \nmy philosophy is , if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful , kind girl , you should treat her like a princess and respect her . \ndarnell doesn't think like this . \nhe sleeps with these girls once and dumps them . \nand by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target , beautiful , wealthy brandi web (

sorry for this guy ? \" \nafter all , it is largely darnell's fault . \nif he is lining up all these women , you'd think he'd have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day , as his mother says it does . \nbut he doesn't , so you get the sense that he's not only irresponsible , but also pretty dumb . \nyou especially get this sense that he's dumb after brandi tells him she

by edward yang ; written by yang and wu nien-chen ; cinematography by christopher doyle and chang hui-kung \nevery country has , eventually , its new wave . \nfrance had its nouvelle vague , brazil its cinema novo , china its fifth generation , and on and on . \nsome waves just take longer than others , before they wash over us , cleansing us with the balm of discovery . \ntaiwan's new wave came in the 1980s , in the work of directors like hou hsiao-hsien , wan jen , and edward yang ; that day , on the beach--yang's first feature--is central . \nit created a new language for young taiwanese directors , even if the first attempts to speak that language were hesitant and faltering . \nlater works refined the techniques that yang first explored here , giving taiwan a distinctive international presence . \nthat day itself is long and frustrating , the document of a nation's attempt to find a voice . \nit does not lack ambition . \nit anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan , in the manner of antonioni , elaborating the alienation that the westernized white-collar middle-class feel as their lives are shaped by old-fashioned roles--dedicated career men , loyal housewives--that they find unfulfilling . \njia-li ( sylvia chang ) is the focus , but the film brings others into its compass--her husband , her brother , friends from her college days--as it charts her discontents . \nno one is happy . \njia-li married her husband , we-lei , at a young age . \nat the time , her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage , despite his affection for another woman , and so jia-li's marriage seemed , in comparison , a good one : she chose we-lei of her own free will , they loved each other . \nbut it goes wrong . \nthat day dutifully presents all the clich ? s : we-lei becomes absorbed in his career , indulges in an affair with a co-worker ; jia-li feels restless and trapped , bound by a choice she made while young , but which no longer seems wise . \nthe film never redeems these clich ? s by conveying the feel of authentic experience , the intensity of lived pain , and much of it seems trite and belaboured . \nit unfolds , awkwardly , as a series of flashbacks , told during a luncheon in vienna , where jia-li meets her brother's old flame ( teresa hu ) , now a concert pianist , whom she has not seen since college . \nboth women seem rather sad , and resigned to their sadness . \ntheir circumstances ( and those of jia-li's brother and a college friend ) suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices--married the wrong man , chosen the wrong career path , etc . --but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate . \nit is not that jia-li married the wrong man ; she didn't . \nthe problem is that she needed to marry at all--and that if she did not marry , she would still be just as unhappy . \nfor a woman in modern taiwan , that day tells us , the cards are stacked , the dice are loaded : she can play the game , but the house always wins . \nthe film's sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan . \nseen now , it does not seem provocative . \nindeed , it's hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy : it may be ambitious , it may be innovative , but it is also terribly , terribly dull . \nand what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us : yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others , and his use of those methods is fumbling , uncertain , undisciplined . \nnor does he bring anything new--other than the locale--to the material . \nthere are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives for--in a young couple's first kiss , in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husband's mistress--but they are brief . \ntoo often , yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes--grocery shopping , flower-arranging--in which nothing happens , little is said , no emotion imparted . \nperhaps , if the film were content to focus on such reflective , inward moments , leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings , it might have been ambiguous , suggestive , insinuating . \nbut jia-li and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence : they talk about their problems , at length , in detail , redundantly , and eliminate all subtleties . \nat two hours and forty-five minutes , it all seems exorbitantly long , indulgently long-winded . \nconsider the defining moment for jia-li , the titular day on the beach . \nthe thrust of the whole film explains , easily enough , what we are to think of that moment , what it means when she walks away from a particular situation . \neven so , the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally , in case we may have missed the point . \nneedless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed , and that is the problem throughout . \nthe look of the film is as tedious as the drawn-out narrative . \nit was the first feature shot by christopher doyle--at least , it's his name in the credits--who is now rightly regarded as one of the world's leading cinematographers . \nin the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong kar-wai , he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image . \nyou would never know it from watching that day , which , due either to doyle's inexperience or yang's humdrum direction , is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical

some perspective . \neven dumb movies can do that for me , sometimes . \ni tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment , but i am certain now that austin powers would have also sucked rocks through bamboo shoots on the day i won the lottery . \nmichael myers has taken a character that would barely have supported a five-minute sketch on saturday night live and stretched it to the length of a feature film , padding it out with toilet jokes and the sort of props-strategically-positioned-between-naked-actors-and-camera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago . \nthe plot , what little there is of it : back in the swinging mod hep sixties ( i don't think i'm doing a disservice to the movie's attempted early look and feel by describing it that way ) , sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr . evil . \nevil launched himself into orbit and cryogenically forze himself to return decades later , when powers was out of the picture . \npowers also had himself frozen , and he wakes up to find the nineties a very hard time to deal with . \nthe basic gag , that of powers' total inability to cope with the nineties , is not so much exhausted during the course of the movie as never even really dealt with . \nthe bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several basic rubrics : james bond gags ( of which this movie has no end , right down to the silly character names ) , inept slapstick , toilet humor , and strategically placed props . . . \nthe movie's amazingly bereft of ideas , come to think of it , with a couple of bright exceptions . \none is dr . evil's son -- there is a sidesplitting scene where father and son go to an encounter group , chaired by carrie fisher -- and the other is a throwaway gag where austin mimics various forms of transportation from behind a couch ( it's a visual gag -- hard to describe , and hard to recommend seeing the movie for ) . \na lot of sixties kitsch has been resurrected and thrown on the screen for this movie , but it's desperate rather than clever . \ninstead of skewering the whole thing , it's a rather bloodless and unfunny tribute . \nmyers himself is also desperate : he's given an idea to play , not a character . \nplus , the attempts to make the character work by giving him a relationship with another sexy ( albeit \" nineties \" ) agent are a waste of time . \ni wanted to have the movie end with him trying yet again to get it on with her , only to have her deck him one . \nwith a couple of exceptions , the movie misses all of its own best moments . \nthe movie even looks cheesy , and not in a good way : i kept wondering if it had been transferred down from hi-def video or something , so grainy was the film stock in a good many scenes . \nthe whole thing has the air of being done on the cheap . \nmy definition of comedy is simply : did it make me laugh ? \nthe few times that i laughed in austin powers were completely offset by the time i spent cringing and wanting out . \nthe most damning thing i could say about the movie is that wayne and garth would most likely have shoved it into mike tyson's shorts and sent it sailing . \n", "tag": 0}, {"content": "in our time . \nin our modern world , where the cool rule , it's hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming 'the man' . \nand yet - film after film , after film , is based on his everlasting magic . \nin warner brothers' latest production , shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat , while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away . \nthough the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare's 'romeo and juliet' , its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york , is very hard to associate with shakespeare's poetry . \nthe film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city - the afro americans against the chinese . \nthe youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered . \nthe afro-americans are immediately suspected , but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers . \nit is at this point that han ( the romeo of the story ) finds out about his brother's death . \nescaping from a prison in china , he returns to united states to avenge his brother's fate . \nbut before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks , he falls in love with a mysterious beauty . \nthe only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy . . \nthere's only a weak echo of shakespeare's talent in this disappointing production . \nand there are more problems besides its title . \nof course we don't call it a deformation of a great masterpiece . \nwe call it 'modernization' . \nit seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics , without any car chases and gun fights . \nthis lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing . \nkenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn't need to be updated , because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature . \nand as long as love , hate , honesty and corruption do exist , everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare . \ni must admit that i found 'rome must die' very confusing . \ni can forgive andrzej bartkowiak , since it is his first attempt at directing . \nhe manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision . \nunfortunately he completely forgot about character- and story developments . \nhis latest picture is therefore visually impressive , but intellectually hollow . \nthe love story between han ( jet li ) and trish ( aalyah ) , and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified . \njet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice . \ntheir achievement save this film from being completely braindead , but they are not actors , and therefore can not act . \nthey are nothing more than two celebrities put together . \nthe other actors , including isaiah washington , russell wong , henry o and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances . \ndelroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality . \nbut there's more than acting to worry about . \neven with li's incredible skills in martial arts , the action scenes ( though technically excellent ) are too long and story updates simply embarrassing . \nto make a long story short : 'romeo must die' is not intelligent enough to be a thriller , not sensual enough to be a love story and too serious to be a fun action film . \nit is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to 'romeo and juliet' , so the film is completely stuck - not sure of what to be . \nand in the end it's nothing . \nthere are no performances worthy of notice , no interesting character- or story surprises . \nso again , the only good thing about it is its technical achievement . \nthis film can boast of great sound , fast paced editing , solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences . \nthe music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre . \nit is mostly provided by aalyah's enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists , that create a kind of 'ghetto feel' to it . \nbut when i think back , it's not much i remember from this 'production' . \nas in almost every summer movie , there are some interesting scenes , but most of the moments that i remember are associated with massive special effects . \nit is not a film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities , simply because it doesn't have any . \nfor someone who has never read shakespeare , it's another popcorn film . \nfor those of us who has , it's a waste of money , time and brain cells . \n", "tag": 0}, {"content": "about an hour or so into \" the jackal , \" a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence , and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out \" i hope she gets killed now ! \" \nat that point it hit me : i didn't care for any of the characters being played by actors i didn't really like . \nwhen the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he's being played by sidney poitier , you know something's rotten in the state of denmark . \nevery year , a couple films like this are released . \nyou know : the cheap , action packed international espionnage film , featuring a semi-promising premise , some big-name actors ( usually bruce willis ) , and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago . \nthis was the third one of '97 , following the very lackluster \" the saint , \" which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe ; and the surprisingly fun \" the peacemaker , \" featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain . \n \" the jackal \" tries to mix both elements . \nand you thought \" the saint \" was bad . \n \" the jackal \" is loosely ( very loosely , i hope ) based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i've yet to see , \" the day of the jackal , \" which featured ( apparently ) a suave hitman called the jackal , played by edward fox , trying to assasinate charles degaule . \nwell , welcome to the 90s , where a sorta suave hitman , also called the jackal ( bruce willis ) , trying to kill the head of the fbi . . . or \nis he ? \nafter being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother ( killed in the opening scenes ) , the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere , from helsinki to virginia , setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he'll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion . \nand like the saint , the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people . \nthe agent working on the case , cater preston ( sidney poitier - yes , that sidney poitier ) , working with a russian agent , valentina koslova ( diane venora - lady capulet from \" romeo + juliet \" ) , gives up early on and meets with an ex-ira man , declan mulqueen ( richard gere , putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of '97 ) who's in a massachusetts jail , but who has apparently seen the jackal , who has been eluding the law forever . \nsoon , he's out working with the two untrusting agents , and trying to help them catch him . \nthere are numerous problems with the film , and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on . \nthe film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller , but save a couple moments , the film never achieves suspense , or even a sense of intrigue . \nsure , the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense , but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register . \nthe film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience , or even an entertaining one . \nit doesn't help that the plot is designed to be complex , but falls into so many problems , like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances . \nthe script of \" the jackal \" is a complete mess , mostly because it can't decide what it wants to focus on . \nis this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer ? \nis it a film about a nasty , amoral hitman who's in everything for the money ? \nor is it a combination of both ? \n \" the jackal \" aims for the latter , but never focuses in on either character . \nthe connection between the two feels completely edited , so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan , you wonder how he recognized him so fast . \nthe worst part is the little past they try to give declan , most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then . \nthe supporting characters are worse . \nsidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role , that of a man who is just stern sometimes , and other times more giving and likable . \nwhat is poitier doing here ? \nhe's one of the best living actors ! \ndoes he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ? \ndiane venora's russian character is almost as bad , with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth , and a plastered on expressionless facade . \nit's not that anyone's bad here ; it's that they have nothing to do . \nthe plot is a joke , feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post-production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time . \nthe jackal himself is not even much of an international villain . \nthere are several times where he's in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself , the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill . \ntake a scene where he's being followed by some agents into a parking garage : he quickly sprays his car another color , and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it . \ndoesn't killing someone attract more attention than it does distract ? \nand does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place ? \ngeez ! \nis there anything good here ? \nwell . . . a \ncouple things . \ni did like willis's icy expressions ; he may not have been real suave or anything , but some of his looks are worth a chuckle . \nrichard gere has a couple of good moments , making his character as likable as he possibly could have . \nand a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous , completely inane but fun kinda way , most notably : a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder ( jack black ) ; and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man , which has its share of a couple good jokes , most particular a kiss by willis . \nbut none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go ; they're just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is \" the jackal . \" \ndirector michael caton-jones ( who directed the far superior \" rob roy \" ) has made a film that is made very couple months , one that is unentertaining , unintriguing , and pretty much cold , but will nevertheless make money because , hey , the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro-clancy kinda way . \nevery now and then , the filmmakers get it right ( \" clear and present danger , \" which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way ) , but \" the jackal \" is an example of when they go completely wrong . \n", "tag": 0}, {"content": "i'm not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing \" disturbing behavior \"

which i guess includes me . \nbut this is not the next in line with the \" scream \" flicks as well as the \" i know what you did last summer \" soon to be flicks . \nit owes less to \" halloween \" and more to kafka and orwell , which , in my book , makes for a more interesting feature . \nand it should have been . \nthis is basically a rehash of \" the stepford wives , \" the great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross and dealing , as i've been told , with a bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives . \nor something like that . \n \" behavior , \" starring katie holmes of \" dawson's creek , \" deals with a bunch of teenagers , deep in angst , who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers . \nsuck-ups . \npreppies . \nit actually , at least to me , sounds like it would work , and with scott rosenberg , that witty penmen who has written stuff like \" beautiful girls \" and \" things to do in denver when you're dead \" ( as well as \" con air \" ) , it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights and satiric wit . \nalas , it's not , and it plumets into that little group of movies known as \" the movies with potential that blow it . \" \ni remember a film called \" white man's burden \" which dealt with a reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing with it's potentially brilliant premise . \nhere's another one . \nit could be a brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves . \nit's a stage , and this film does in fact realize that . \nit gets its message across and it does it effortlessly . \nnow it just needs to work as a film . \nwhich it doesn't . \nit's too sloppy and too contrived . \nit paints a bleak portrait of high school life . . . then \nlets it lie . \nit brings us a bunch of scary monsters who are all a bunch of disgustingly icky kiss-ups who do food drives and hang out at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes . . . then \ngives it a cheap twist : when they get horny , they become homicidal . \nisn't it scary enough that they're like this , and can't the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them - not that you could be next to die ? \nthe film introduces us two three different characters who , in the beginning , are considered outsiders because they're not ( yet ) part of this clique : the new kid , steve ( james marsden - dull dull dull dull ) , who's having trouble at home because he hasn't gotten over his brother's ( ethan embry , in quick flashes so you don't recognize him - i did ) suicide ; the renegade girl , rachel ( katie holmes , from \" dawson's creek \" ) , who's chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring ; and by far the most interesting kid , gavin ( nick stahl , the kid from \" the man without a face \" ) , who's the most interesting because he's the only character who's given some dimension . \nin the film's best scene , he introduces steve to every single clique , nailing each one's fetishes and hang-ups , and it's the best scene in the movie because it's witty , satirical , and interesting - something the rest of this film isn't . \ngavin suspects there's something awry with the preppie kids , known as the blue ribbons , and in the tradition of all conspirators , and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve , he's only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff . \nhere , we have another case of \" the idiot plot , \" where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him , but he may have saved this film from being the dreary , dull film that it is without gavin , who gives it life and humor . \nthe only other half-interesting character is the school janitor , played by william sadler as a retarded , scary guy who may not be what he seems to be . . . but \nreally , we don't care anyway . \ni probably shouldn't mention that this was directed by david nutter , who's works for \" the x-files , \" because that would probably tarnish his reputation . \nlike the show , he's good at setting up weird conspiracies , and creating a general creepy feel . \nmost of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect , and some of it works . \nbut what this film is not so good at is coming out with a good payoff . \nhe keeps too much inside , so much that when the characters journey to a mental institution in the third act , you wonder why they just don't get the hell out of there . \ni think what happens to gavin is proof enough that there's something rotten in the state of teen angstdom . \nwhat this film needs to be is a lot longer , a lot more colorful , and a lot creepier . \nif the best villain they can come up with is a guidance counselor ( played by bruce greenwood , an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent ) who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed , then they need to come up with a tougher , smarter villain . \nif he's so villainous , then why could two dense teenagers who couldn't figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in a couple minutes ? \nthe film , which runs about 80 or so minutes , just needs to work on these things , and become a lot less sloppy . \nat such a short running time and with such lame , boring characters as these , it's pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in one's mouth , especially mine . \n", "tag": 0}, {"content": "1989's \" major league \" was

and offensive pseudo-depth . \nwhat's worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic -- the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm . \njohn travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess , playing warrant officer paul brenner ; brenner is

unrealistic dialogue and \" shocking \" plot developments . \nhaving not read the novel , it's difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author , but i

over . \" ) \nonly after we've spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together ; this angle , though apparently present to develop their characters , is never explored . \nnot that it really matters , since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot . \nin one scene , sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask . \nshe sees one of his rings , and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring . \ninstead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect , they take him to brenner's houseboat , beat him up , and pour hot coffee in his lap . \nthis scene really pushed me over the edge , not because it's gratuitous and mean-spirited , but because it illustrates the film's complete disregard for the characters and the audience . \nit was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene , mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise . \ni realized that these constructs on screen aren't actually characters , but devices present only to serve the story . \nthis would have been bad enough without the west's need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct . \ncompelling films about sexual crimes don't spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks , and they certainly don't show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture . \nthese scenes are not the least bit powerful ; on the contrary , they're intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain , whomever that may turn out to be . \nin addition , the movie treats sexual fetishes -- and sadomasochism in particular -- as if it's a perversion of everything we know to be pure . \nthis standpoint is certainly allowed , but only in accompaniment with well-developed themes to back it up . \nas it is , the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes , and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane . \nperhaps the only positive elements in the general's daughter are a couple of the performances . \njames woods has a few terrific scenes , and plays his role with sharp , witty subtlety . \ni also liked james cromwell , mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous . \nnonetheless , these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary , obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization . \nthe general's daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film -- it

two years . \nhe's not supposed to be tracking him any more -- according to the bureau , they've got their man -- but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise . \ntwo months earlier , lacrosse's own son was kidnapped by the killer , and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere . \nlacrosse knows his killer's work , and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game . \nit wouldn't be fair to reduce everything that's wrong with switchback to quaid's presence , but it's a pretty good place to start . \nthere's a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center : as a dramatic actor , dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation . \nwe can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tight-jawed , sourpuss pucker ; we can tell he's grim because every word comes out in an eastwood-esque rasp . \na more flexible performer might have given weight to the character , pulling the audience into his haunted intensity , making switchback _his_ film . \nquaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated . \nit's tough to become emotionally invested in

from the novel by nicholas sparks ) \ncast : kevin costner , robin wright-penn , paul newman , illeana douglas , robbie coltrane , jesse james , john savage . \nreview by : geoff berkshire \ni'm not an overly cynical guy . \nthere have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years . \nhowever , i have my limits and i also have standards . \nthis brings us to the subject at hand : message in a bottle , the big ticket romance that warner brothers' unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for valentine's day . \nthe story , what little of it that there is , involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne ( robin wright-penn ) dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason ( jesse james ) . \nduring a brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean . \nthe letter , written to a mystery woman named catherine , instantly captivates her . \nupon her return , theresa shares it with her best friend lina ( illeana douglas ) , her boss charlie ( robbie coltrane ) , and the entire city of chicago ( the newspaper publishes an article about it ) . \nit turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake ( kevin costner ) and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down . \nhe turns out to have a colorful father ( paul newman ) but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing . \nthis is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship . \nof course she doesn't tell him that she found his letter , she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later ( preferably right after they first make love ) . \nthis way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened . \nthe discovery of the message and garret's discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film . \nthere's a truly lame subplot about garret's relationship with his dead wife's family ( he gets into a bar fight with her brother , played by john savage ) and then the necessary tear-jerking ending . \na fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die , although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel . \nthe actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced , and unintentionally humorous , sequences filmed since . . . \nwell , since costner's the postman ( 1997 ) . \nmessage in a bottle is one slow moving film . \nlast year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer and meet joe black but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this . \nthey also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work . \nmessage in a bottle has a decent enough cast but they're fighting the material all the way , and losing badly . \ncostner and , especially , wright-penn are both likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too boring . \nthey also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry . \nthe supporting players are given very little to do . \nthe reliable douglas is particularly wasted . \nold pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film . \na confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played . \nhowever , too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are . \nthe film is very polished on the technical side to be sure but it only works to undercut the story . \ngabriel yared , who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient ( 1996 ) and city of angels ( 1998 ) with his scores , overdoes it a bit here . \ncaleb deschanel's camera makes everything look a little too beautiful . \ndo the offices of the chicago tribune really need to look heavenly ? \nthe editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times . \nthe real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego . \nworking from a best- selling novel by nicholas sparks ( which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county ) , di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times . \nits strict adherence to clich ? s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer ( 1998 ) . \nthere simply isn't an original scene in this film . \nthe dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking . \nthis is director mandoki's first film since when a man loves a woman ( 1994 ) , the solid meg ryan/andy garcia romance . \nhe's simply going through the motions with this . \nmessage in a bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come ( 1998 ) as one of the most misguided romances of the decade . \n", "tag": 0},

difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting . \nwes studi , cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the last of the mohicans , was perfect choice for geronimo , not only because he resembles geronimo , but because he induces a lot of passion in his role . \ncontrary to him , we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies . \nwhile this could be expected from someone like jason patric , it is shame when we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall . \neven hill's directing is bellow expectations - battle scenes are too short and , like in many of his late films , force viewers to ask what had happened to the great action director of 1970s . \neven his old associate , music composer ry cooder , disappoints , with the score that shifts between indian motives and classic . \non the other hand , photography by lloyd ahern ii , with the use of red lenses , gives somewhat

there is the script by james herzfeld , whose only other film , tapeheads from a decade ago , was so awful that it is considered a cult classic . \nmeet the deedles , however , is painfully bad rather than laughably bad . \nit will probably be in and out of the theaters like a tornado and is in no danger of becoming a classic anything . \nherzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes \" your geyser's a geezer , \" and \" i'd like to put a deedle in her haystack . \" \nas the movie opens , the twins , who at one point describe themselves modestly as \" a walking kodak moment , \" are celebrating their 18th birthday . \nas they ride a parasail high above the waters of waikiki , a truant officer pursues them on his jet ski . \nas heirs to the fabulous fortune of the deedle empire , the boys are sent by their father to camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform the two laid-back beach bums into men . \nas they arrive in their wetsuits in yellowstone , they've got their surfboards , skateboards , and a hawaiian drink machine the size of an armoire . \ntheir camp has gone out of business , but they are mistaken for new park rangers . \nthe rest of the movie has them fighting the park's overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as a deranged ex-ranger , played by dennis hopper , who is out to stop old faithful before its billionth birthday celebration , scheduled for later in the week . \nhopper , who has made some wonderful movies , carried away being a recent favorite , does have a propensity for choosing some truly odoriferous material . \nthis isn't his worst acting , but meet the deedles is arguably the worst movie he's ever been in . \nsteve van wormer and paul walker , as stew and phil , give lifeless performances . \nthe only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute little prairie dog named petey . \neven the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic that it manages to make yellowstone look dull . \nto add insult to injury , hennings is fond of inappropriate close-ups , which only serve to remind us of the inanity of the dialog . \nput a ten-foot pair of lips on the screen , and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said . \nalthough boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film is appropriate for families , one wonders how many skateboarders will attempt the movie's stunt of lying on your back on a skateboard while negotiating a busy and twisting mountain road . \nthey make it look like so much fun that i'm sure many will try some variation of the stunt . \n \" how could this possibly be worst , \" asks phil . \njust when you suspect it can't , the movie takes a turn further downhill . \nits low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag . \nafter phil's girlfriend digs up a big mount of moist soil , they suck in a long worm . \nlike the two dog lovers eating spaghetti in lady and the tramp , their lips finally meet in a kiss . \nas they pull back , their faces are full of the dirt that encased the worm they have just ingested . \nmeet the deedles runs about an hour and a half . \nit is rated pg for a little bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids around 6 and up . \nmy son jeffrey and his friend nickolas , both almost 9 , gave the show * * * . \nthey both thought the scenes with petey were among their favorites . \nnickolas also mentioned the scene in which the circus bear drives a jeep , and jeffrey especially liked the one in which the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo . \n", "tag": 0}, {"content": " \" love to kill \" starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes . \nat the outset , the movie appears to be about tony danza , who's an illegal distributor of guns , trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman . \ndanza sets up a double date with her , her sister , and a collegue of his . \neverything seems to be going well , until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs . \nmuch confusion and mahem ensues , as the death is covered up and other associates of danza's begin to emerge , all after one thing or another . \nsound confusing ? \nit is . \ni think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity . \nin some respects , it works . \nbut the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess . \ncharacters keep popping up with no explanation , demanding money for deals that occur off-screen . \nthe only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead woman's sister . \nbut so little time is devoted to this part of the story , we never really become too familiar with these characters , and because of this , we don't really care what happens to them . \nwell , i didn't , at least . \none thing i will give the movie is that it's a complete departure for tony danza . \nhere's a guy , because of his many sitcom roles , who's ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing . \nhere , he plays a man who's just looking out for himself , and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin , so be it . \ni was very impressed by his performance , and within minutes of the start of the film , i had forgotten all about his good-guy persona . \nmichael madsen is also good as an associate of danza's who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him . \nlike i said , it's not exactly a linear storyline . \n \" love to kill \" should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre , but it's just too bad that the story doesn't really add up to much . \nthe stars deserved better , and so did the audience . \n",

majors . \nnice to see you , jim . \nas a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer , can you give us the scoop on the new flick ? \njb : my opinion : the producers should have stopped while they were ahead , and that was nine years ago . \none entry was definitely enough , and i'm surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2 . this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct-to-video . \nit's worse than a mediocre made-for-tv feature . \ni should also mention that this movie likely won't play all that well in cleveland . \nnow that the real indians are perennial contenders , they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks . \nactually , most of the action involves the twins' aaa minor league club , the buzz , rather than the actual major league franchise . \nhc : sorry to interrupt , jim , but we still have to do play-by-play for the game on the field . \nleading off this inning is john warren . \nhe steps into the batter's box and takes kent's pitch low for ball one . \nwh : so , the story's strictly minor league , right ? \nwhat's it about ? \njb : scott

the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano ( dennis haysbert ) , rube baker ( eric bruskotter ) , and isuro tanaka ( takaaki ishibashi ) , gus gets the buzz on the right track . \nin fact , he is

already seen the box score . \non top of that , none of the mock-ups are presented with much flair . \nthey're not just boring ; they're lackluster . \nbut the major league movies have never been about drama or tension ; they've been about using baseball situations to generate laughs . \nhc : warren fouls off a fastball . \n1 and 1 . \nwh : are there lots of yuks in this one ? \njb : not one ,

any glaring errors like there were in one of the best-ever baseball movies , the natural . \nbut i'd gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story , believable characters , or even a little genuine humor . \nheck , the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league : back to the minors . \nwh : it's nice to see old friends one more time , isn't it ? \nlike cerrano , tanaka , and dorn . \njb : depends on whether you really care that anyone is back . \nthere aren't any real characters here ? just an assortment of cliched oddballs . \nyeah , the voodoo hitter , the catcher who can't throw back to the pitcher , the japanese player , and the conceited player-turned-owner have all returned , but who really cares ? \nthey have no depth . \nnotable absences

field of dreams , bull durham , or even the first major league into the vcr . \nactually , this is an oddly-timed release , since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in

pieces of suspense and comedy . \neddie murphy was in bad shape for a while . \nand this invites me to mention last year s \" the nutty professor , \" which was his blessed revival back to the position at which he used to be . \n \" metro \" happens to be a lot better than any film in the \" beverly hills cop \" series . \nthat is because \" metro \" takes itself seriously , but doesn t prevent itself from having a little fun . \neddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible , and controlled people . \nthe \" beverly hills cop \" movies all featured eddie as a reckless , wild cop , always crossing the line by just an inch . \nin \" metro \" he plays a hostage negotiator , so negotiation is his job , not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble . \nhis character in \" metro \" takes himself seriously . \neddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in \" metro , \" and perhaps it is quite better off that way . \nmurphy plays scott roper , and as i previously mentioned , he is a san francisco hostage negotiator . \nin the first tense situation in the film , we are introduced to roper s kind of work , as he tries to calm down a confused , unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up . \nmurphy handles the scene seriously , without his usual happy-go-lucky , misfit humor . \nthe film develops when its villain is established , and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda , a jewel thief , and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim . \n \" metro \" takes different twists and slight turns , and there is one great , virtuoso chase scene , involving the a cable car . \ncars flip . \ncars crash . \ncars turn over . \nand it is done so good in this film , i was reminded of \" speed , \" and the speeding bus that couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons . \nthere are also some other good scenes in \" metro \" that a lot of films would rather choose not to have . \nscenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and winning . \nof course , the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling . \nthe scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice , too . \nthose are the scenes that make up \" metro , \" which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality . \nthe actor that i most enjoyed seeing in \" metro \" was michael rapaport , who plays roper s new partner , a lip-reading , book-skimming genius , and a master of observation . \nit was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius . \nrapaport is an actor who i usually see in the role of the dimwit the really , really dopey dimwit . \ni hardly recognized him in \" metro , \" and it was quite a joy to be able to see him in a role like this i feel that i respect him more . \nthere are two main types of villains in movies like this : the ones that are part of the story , and the ones that are devices . \nthe villain in \" metro \" is no more than a device , but he is a darn good villain nonetheless . \nhe is played by michael wincott , whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp , as if he smokes a cigarette between every take . \nwincott makes his villain , korda , as mean as could be , the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks , like richard widmark in \" kiss of death . \" \nand , in addition , wincott s physical appearance and mannerisms , in the film , actually reminded my of an arrogant friend i use to have , who is no longer on my good list . \ni liked \" metro , \" and i do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy . \nhis past roles were the great ones but they were also a precursor to the maturing that would later take place , possibly from murphy s growing as a person , now having a family . \n \" metro \" is a no-nonsense movie . \nit works as a buddy movie , which it does not overplay . \nit works as a dry comedy , which it does not overplay . \nit works as a suspense film , which it does not overplay . \nand it works as an action film , where it does have a tendency to occasionally go all-out . \nbut who cares ? \nit still remains serious , and it does not overdo itself . \noh , and there were plenty of explosions in \" metro , \" as well . \nhow nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those . \nif there is one major objection i had to \" metro \" , it was the length , an area where a lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes . \n \" metro \" is a film that lasted a little too long , but it was still entertaining , and it gave me something to do while i waited for it to end . \npaul haynes \" > \n", "tag": 0}, {"content": "fantastically over hyped , godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen . \nthe film opens with footage of

prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie . \nthe film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it's evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . \nenduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious . \nthe qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium . \ntectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences . \nit's not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , \" look ! \nart ! \" ) , \nalthough it keeps the audience distanced from the characters . \nbecause we're constantly made aware that we're watching a play or a movie , it's impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer's ideas . \nthey're not real , sympathetic , or believable . \ni'm willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success . \ntectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) . \none day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself . \nwhile preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re-think her decision . \nmeanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host . \nwith settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else . \nhowever , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers . \nthe tone is soporific , the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn't take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious . \ntectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point . \nthere are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren't bilingual ) . \nthe only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it's different , ( b ) it's not like anything they've seen before , and ( c ) it's pretentious . \nfor everyone else , it's not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage . \n", "tag": 0}, {"content": "

\nby the end , will the underdog overcome great odds and triumph ? \nwill everyone in the town turn against the coach ? \nwill the team win the climactic game ? \ndo cats bathe themselves regularly ? \nthe so-called \" hero \" in question is john moxin ( james van der beek ) , a senior at west canaan high school who plays for the varsity football team , but is really just hoping to get a scholarship at brown university so that he can get out of the dead-end town . \nat least he's got the right idea , since west canaan , texas is portrayed in the film as , frankly , pathetic , with the whole town treating the weekly football games as the second coming . \nheck , in one scene , the front page of the town's newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers' big win the night before . \nwhen the team's star quarterback is severely injured , tearing the ligaments in his leg , john finds himself taking over as the team's leader , but his few minutes of glory do not last long , as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend ( amy smart ) when she discovers he spent an evening with another girl ( ali larter ) . \nand after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint ( all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics ) , the team loses their second-to-last game , putting john at feuds with the coach ( jon voight who , like gary oldman , is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the \" bad guy \" ) . \nworse yet , the coach is threatening to ruin john's scholarship chances if the badgers don't win their final game . \nthe plotting of \" varsity blues \" is as old as the hills , and contains every cliche in the book . \nadmittedly , i was never exactly bored while i was watching it , but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained . \nthroughout , all i could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with a great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983's \" all the

tv's \" dawson's creek \" ) , is pretty much a bore without any engaging qualities . \nwhile i probably shouldn't blame this on van der beek , since the inauspicious and \" by-the-numbers \" screenplay by w . peter iliff isn't of any help , he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in \" all the right moves . \" \nthe story revolving around john , meanwhile , is extemely thin throughout , particularly for its 104-minute running time , and it alternates between uninspired comic relief ( as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club ) and heavy-handed melodrama . \nthe romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot , but we also learned very little about her , which is unfortunate since amy smart , whom i don't think i've seen before in past films , is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence . \nsmart does not allow her character to become the \" passive girlfriend , \" instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas and opinions . \nit's too bad the camera didn't linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts . \nthe adult characters probably fare the worse of any , since they all must play residents of a dim-witted town that cares about nothing but football . \njohn's relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance . \nhis father is set on him becoming a football player at a university , but john doesn't want any part of that . \nhis mother stands beside her \" big , strong husband \" and is a passive female . \nfinally , jon voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make the thankless role any more than one-dimensional . \nsaving \" varsity blues \" from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences , including one set in the sex education class , which did get a laugh out of me . \nthe scenes of playing football were well-shot and thankfully didn't overstay their welcome , as many sports films fall victim to . \nbut leaving the theater , the question i had in my mind was why did this film need to be made ? \ni seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately , since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood . \ndo we really need another high-school sports film ? \nno , we don't , and certainly not one of this low-caliber , which felt like a cut-and-paste job of spare parts from much better , but similar , films . \n \" varsity blues , \" no doubt is the first one , however , to include an earnest scene in

military officer whose uniform shirt is so wrinkled he looks like he is a recruit on his first day of training . \nor what about when brenner tells a suspect that , because he is in the military , he doesn't have the right not to answer his questions even though these rights were central to military law well before the miranda decision . \nhow hard is it to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts ? \nnow details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up , but this story is so full of holes it is painful to sit through . \nfor example , at the beginning of the film , paul brenner , an undercover army investigator , gets into a gun and knife battle at his off-post houseboat and winds-up killing an arms dealer he had been investigating . \nthe local police investigating the death are openly hostile to the military and they discover that brenner has been lying to them about the killing . \nbut instead of arresting him , or at least take him into custody for further questioning , they release him . \nduh ! \nultimately , brenner gets assigned to investigate the murder and possible rape of the commanding general's daughter , a young captain also assigned to the post . \nwhen brenner finds graphic sex tapes featuring the general's daughter , does he use them to generate a suspect list and begin grilling suspects . \nno , his instinct is to suppress them because they might be potentially embarrassing . \neventually , brenner discovers that this murder is related to a violent gang rape at west point eight years earlier . \ni won't even go into the totally unbelievable rationale for the army's suppression of this horrendous crime . \ni will just mention one final flaw . \nbrenner is investigating a crime that occurred in georgia . \nthe rape occurred in west point , which is in new york . \nhe is under a very tight ( and totally implausible ) 36-hour deadline to solve this case . \nhe needs to discuss the rape with a psychiatrist at west point . \ndoes he phone the doctor ? \nno , he travels ( via some unexplained very fast transport ) to new york to question the psychiatrist in person , and then he returns to georgia ( again by the miracle transport ) , without once worrying about the impact any of this will have on his deadline . \nyou have been warned , stay away from this one . \n", "tag": 0},

swimsuit issues . \nif you thought kathy ireland was laughable in alien from l . a . , you'll change your mind when you see fair game . \nireland would win handfuls of oscars if this was her only competition . \nin a real casting coup , crawford plays a super-intelligent lawyer ( in a jogging bra , of course ) . \nwe all know this is a stretch , the only legal opinion crawford has ever put forth being that she favors the death penalty for anyone who wears white after labor day . \nnonetheless , someone out there thought she'd make a good lawyer , but we're reminded of her true function

adds up to a really terrible movie that made me laugh in plenty of places i wasn't supposed to and grimace in places i was supposed to laugh . \none more thing fair game has against it is some awful

\ni wouldn't , but not because i'm a computer nerd . \nit's just not funny . \ncrawford's only contribution to the information age are a few gif files floating around with her head on a nude traci lords' body . . . \nor was it jack lord's body ? \ni'll leave you with the final line of dialogue in the movie . \nthe boat with all the russians has just blown up and baldwin and crawford are floating on a life raft . \ncrawford says woodenly , \" that was my client's boat you just blew up . \ni'm filing a lawsuit against you . \nyou're in big trouble , \" or something to that effect , and baldwin replies smugly , \" what do i have to do to get out of it ? \" \nthey of course begin making out and the credits roll . \ni'm not going to talk about how stupid the line is or how , if they'd really wanted to go for a bad closing line they would have had baldwin say , \" you think i could settle out of court ? \" \nbut i will tell you that , if anyone ever suggests you watch fair game with him or her , you quote the final line of the movie to that person : \" what do i have to do to get out of it ? \" \nserving america for over 1/50th of a century ! \n", "tag": 0}, {"content": "an

this sort require a fine balance and careful tone , and the comedy is usually meant to work as catharsis for the violence . \n \" lethal weapon 2 \" ( 1989 ) is a perfect example of an action thriller that was also very , very funny . \nunfortunately , in \" the big hit , \" it seems that comedy is the main motive , and the violence is only intended to punctuate the laughs . \nunfortunately , there are no laughs . \nthe movie resembles some of the goofy , throwaway ridiculousness of early jackie chan films , but it doesn't benefit from chan's incredible stunts and goofy , charismatic presence . \ninstead , we are left with a lot of digital effects and mark wahlberg , who must have considered himself invincible after his critically-acclaimed performance in last year's \" boogie nights . \"

wants us to think , \" gee how clever and ironic - a guy who can kill without any moral implications , and yet he can't stand for anyone not to like him . \" \nthe fact is , melvin is so desperate to keep people from not liking him , that he puts up with both an obnoxious fiancee ( christina applegate , with a horrendous new york accent ) and an abusive girlfriend ( lela rochon ) who is only using him for his money . \nhis constant bending over backwards to please people makes him a complete patsy at best , and a thoroughly unbelievable character at worst . \nmelvin is employed exclusively by a crime boss named paris ( avery brooks ) as part of a team of hitmen , which also includes cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) and crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) . \none day , melvin agrees to do some moonlighting with cisco by kidnapping the teenage daughter of a rich japanese mogul named jiro nishi ( sab shimono ) for a million dollar ransom . \nhowever , not only has jiro nishi lost all his money producing a big hollywood movie ( inside joke , get it ? ) , but his kidnapped daughter , keiko ( china chow ) , also happens to be paris' goddaughter . \nso , when paris finds out she's been kidnapped , he takes it personally and becomes determined to find out who did it . \nnot knowing the cisco is actually behind the whole scheme , paris puts him in charge of rooting out the kidnapper . \nof course cisco blames the whole thing on poor , innocent melvin . \nalong the way , there are several obligatory gunfights , explosions , and car chases , plus a literal cliffhanger inspired by \" jurassic park , \" and a completely unconvincing romance between melvin and keiko ( who looks like she's barely pushing fifteen ) . \nwhat the movie passes off as humor resorts to thoroughly unfunny jokes about overweight jewish mothers , hara-kiri , drinking problems , leaking body bags , and a running gag about how crunch has recently discovered the pleasures of masturbation , and now spends all his time doing hand exercises . \nnot to mention the pimply video store clerk who is always calling melvin and screeching about how he needs to return his copy of \" king kong lives , \" which is

problems can be traced back to the script , which was penned by obvious freshman writer ben ramsey . \nin addition to his vague characterizations and uninspired action sequences , ramsey's script assaults the audience with his attempts to copy the vulgar , poetic rhythms of tarantino or mamet-style dialogue . \nwhat he comes out with is just a lot of annoying blather , most of which spews from the lips of lou diamond phillips ( whose favorite phrase is \" it's all love \" ) and robin dunne , who plays cisco's stuttering , black-wannabe assistant . \nthe irritation factor of phillips and

hitchcock so eloquently used in 1960 aren't as eye-catching now . \nwhat passed for brilliance then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they don't impress or excite . \nvan sant , in what i assume is a grasp at originality , decided to put some stream-of-consciousness images into a few famous scenes ( was that a lamb in the middle of the road ? ) \nthese images , included with some questionable editing choices , took away from the scenes themselves and caused , at first , bewilderment and , later , laughter . \ndefinitely not hitchcock's intention ! \nat least danny elfman had the good sense to not mess with bernard herrmann's original famous and terrific score . \nif a film like \" psycho \" does not frighten , then what's the point . \naside from norman , the

a film to the extent that i will in this particular review . \nhowever , in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful , a minute dissection of the ending is necessary . \neven though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes , do proceed at your own risk . \nthe movie opens ( quite poorly , i might add ) as child psychologist malcolm crowe ( bruce willis , looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene ) and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolm's past patients . \ndistraught , the suicidal man ( a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg ) shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself . \ncut to the \" next fall \" , as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case , a trouble young man named cole ( haley joel osment , one of the only child actors in a while i didn't want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument ) . \nafter about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences , we learn that cole has \" the sixth sense \" , the gift of being able to communicate with the dead . \nand this , as they say , is where the healing begins . \nthe sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film ( one of roger ebert's colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of \" siskel and ebert \" ) . \nalthough i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons , i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise ; i've always been a sucker for surprise endings ( my favorite movie is the usual suspects ) and rarely dislike a film that sports one . \nhere , since i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the film's conclusion , the possibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its ending ( something i've fallen victim to in the past ) was eliminated . \nand indeed , my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment . \nstripped of the element of surprise , the film was put to the task of showing what it really had , instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion . \nafter seeing its true colors , i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is , despite what the many champions of the movie may say , void of any real power . \nit's a neat concept , but not one that justifies being made into a feature-length movie . \nin fact , the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the supposedly earth-shattering revelation that is yet to come . \nand when the final moments do come , it's a huge letdown ; the end makes no sense at all . \nit stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on a fundamental and very rare level . \ni won't go into any details , but suffice to say that , as far as i can tell , it negates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder . \nnow , in all fairness , i cannot say for sure that i would have guessed the ending ( however stupid it may be ) had it not been revealed to me before hand . \nhowever , i feel very confident that i , as well as anyone who had seen a few \" twilight zone \" episodes , would have seen it coming a mile away . \nthe fact that movie-goers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped . \nironically , to fully appreciate the best scene ( that of cole and malcolm attending a little girl's funeral ) , the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy . \ni wouldn't have even known about this mental disease if i hadn't , by pure dumb luck , caught \" dateline nbc \" the other week when they did a feature story on it . \ndespite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography and a brauva performance from osment ( where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace ? ) , in the end , the sixth sense is too chalk-full of contradictions and just isn't plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation . \n", "tag": 0}, {"content": "they should have stuck to the promise emblazoned on the original

the camera , don't try . \nwhat defeats them is the genre they have chosen to spoof . \nthe first movie - an outrageous , low-brow , savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream and i know what

dante's inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street 3 through 6 ) intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and ( supposedly ) haunting images , many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot . \nif there aren't bizarre images floating past the screen , then we get pointless shots of a suicidal alison staring

for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images . \nthe credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and

( and he talks like a darth vader clone without the heavy breathing ) . \nfor some reason though , he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance . \none

dragging/salting sequence . \nthe character in question , dana ( angela zimmely ) , has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated . \na priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken . \nhe picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken , taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever . \nwhen she starts to leave , the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life , walks out , and makes like it wants to be crucified by her . \nthe presence starts to clap annoyingly ( which continues for the rest of the sequence ) until dana takes off with the strange creature following her . \nwhen it finally catches up to her , she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ . \nthe box for the film claims \" because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture , parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18 . \ncontains nudity and
